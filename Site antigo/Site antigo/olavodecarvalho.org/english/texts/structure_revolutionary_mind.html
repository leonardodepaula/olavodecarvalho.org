      <p>Even the best of observers have trouble figuring out what the Left is, 
        or what the difference between left and right is, or what these concepts 
        even mean any more.</p>
      <p>Great strides have been made recently, however, with the recognition, 
        among the most astute observers, that Hitler&#8217;s Third Reich is by 
        no means an example of rightwing ideology and policies in action, contrary 
        to current political doctrine.</p>
      <p>Many conservative writers have already concluded that Hitler was not 
        a rightwinger, based mostly on his National <em>Socialism</em>.</p>
      <p>Indeed Mr. de Carvalho&#8217;s (as yet unpublished) lecture &#8220;The 
        structure of the revolutionary mind,&#8221; cites the recent book &#8220;The 
        Dictators: Hitler&#8217;s Germany and Stalin&#8217;s Russia&#8221; by 
        Richard Overy, which demonstrates the parallels between Hitler and Stalin.</p>
      <p>I had noticed that the compatibility of Hitler&#8217;s ideology with 
        today&#8217;s European relativism was brilliantly highlighted in Ben Stein&#8217;s 
        movie <em>Expelled</em>, and most poignantly in the scene in a former 
        Third Reich mental &#8220;hospital&#8221; where patients deemed to be 
        of no value to society were gassed (I couldn&#8217;t help but think of 
        Terri Schiavo). When Stein asked the tour guide at the museum what she 
        would say if she could talk to the perpetrators of that horror, she simply 
        said that was another era and they had their reasons for doing what they 
        did. Thus she clearly would not feel justified in judging these criminals 
        by her standards (assuming she had any). Here was a woman who had certainly 
        been educated in Germany, either the communist East Germany or the socialistic 
        West Germany. Neither system prepared her to condemn Hitler&#8217;s actions 
        because these actions were based on the same world view that Germany embraces 
        today, atheistic humanism based on a tenacious belief in Darwinist principles 
        of natural selection, and the correlative notion that man has a moral 
        right and even obligation to support natural selection with his laws under 
        which a race can be culled of inferior elements. Neither socialism nor 
        &#8220;national&#8221; socialism reject this out of hand. Only Christianity 
        does, and that religion is fading fast in Europe (while here Christianity 
        is being absorbed by the Left. See <a href="http://laiglesforum.com/2008/07/28/three-strikes-for-rick-warren/">here</a>, 
        <a href="http://laiglesforum.com/2008/02/08/the-purpose-driven-left-turn/">here</a> 
        and <a href="http://laiglesforum.com/2006/12/11/the-religious-left-in-bible-times-part-1/">here</a>).</p>
      <p>All this helps clarify the compatibility between two world views that 
        our education system and mainstream press insist are opposites.</p>
      <p>But surprisingly, despite a lot of keen observation, before Olavo de 
        Carvalho&#8217;s lecture, no one had yet managed to credibly characterize 
        the Left in all of its main facets.</p>
      <p>I have personally grappled with this for many years and had all but despaired 
        of finding an adequate definition. And yet, how can a good American be 
        a good American if he can&#8217;t identify the enemy of his way of life? 
        How can he stand athwart history and shout stop if he doesn&#8217;t know 
        what it is he must stop?</p>
      <p>At the top of the first page of each issue of <em>Izvestia</em> was the 
        slogan &#8220;Workers of the world unite!&#8221; Thus to people of my 
        era, the Left portrayed itself as a system of social justice that aimed 
        at creating a level playing field between workers and their bosses and 
        attempted to share the wealth equally with a view to building a world 
        free of poverty.</p>
      <p>Yet today, we see the Left working hard to make fuel more expensive for 
        the poor, not in any attempt at social justice but rather to &#8220;save 
        the planet.&#8221; The main area where social &#8220;justice&#8221; is 
        sought is between heterosexuals and homosexuals, and the current thrust 
        is toward legalizing same-sex &#8220;marriage&#8221; which, if it triumphs, 
        will trivialize traditional marriage, ultimately prompting fewer to marry 
        and bear children, since part of the attractiveness of marriage has been 
        a sacred religious ceremony affirming one&#8217;s faith, encouraging people 
        to wait until marriage to enjoy sex, and therefore fostering heterosexual 
        purity based on a biblical world view. None of this is apparent in the 
        &#8220;gay&#8221; community with its emphasis on promiscuity (broad daylight 
        naked <a href="http://laiglesforum.com/category/gay-agenda/">orgies</a>) 
        and its rejection of the biblical view of homosexuality. This focus on 
        discouraging child birth is mightily supported by Planned Parenthood. 
        Thus, ultimately, the leftist vision seems to be a world with more poverty 
        and fewer children born to shoulder the burden of caring for the elderly, 
        for example, by paying into the social services system. The once-proud 
        vision of a world of strong healthy workers receiving equal pay for a 
        better, more prosperous life, is quickly giving way to a vision of a world 
        impoverished for the sake of an impersonal planet to whose riches mankind 
        must increasingly forfeit its claims. We are taught that to consider humanity&#8217;s 
        needs is to be selfish, that we must sacrifice our children&#8217;s future 
        for the sake of a planet. And yet we are being asked to sever ties to 
        that planet as if our destiny were separate from its.</p>
      <p>Thus, obviously, the old left and the new left are different ideologically 
        and many ordinary people are confused (particularly since an astounding 
        percentage of Republican politicians embrace the Left&#8217;s policies). 
        Some are confused into thinking that the new Left is more benign. These 
        are the ones who believe the myth that communism is dead.</p>
      <p>In fact, communism never died, it merely metamorphosed.</p>
      <p>How to explain that the Left can completely substitute its original ideology 
        and still be the Left?</p>
      <p>Olavo de Carvalho had wondered the same thing. But he was born into a 
        South American environment where leftism was the air they breathed. It 
        was the worldview in academe and on the street and there was no other 
        box to think outside of. Therefore, as a philosophy student, he was steeped 
        in the literature of the Left, not just Marx and Hegel but the entire 
        pantheon of leftist gods writing the blueprints for society. Thus he had 
        read an enormous amount of this literature and is today one of the few 
        living conservatives-having had his epiphany-who now truly understands 
        the Left, something like David Horowitz, except that de Carvalho had the 
        additional benefit of seeing a much more virulent leftism <em>in action</em> 
        and up close.</p>
      <p>Even so, Mr. Carvalho had to read and reread the old (and new) revolutionary 
        literature to find a common thread, and what he found is surprising:</p>
      <p>The Left (which he calls the &#8220;revolution&#8221;)<em> </em>is<em> 
        not</em> a unified <em>ideology</em> or <em>agenda</em> at all, but rather 
        a way of seeing the world, and specifically it is an inversion of what 
        normal people call common sense. And this inversion is the sole unifying 
        factor, the one common thread running through the revolution since the 
        13th and 14th centuries</p>
      <p>According to de Carvalho, revolutionary thought as we know it did not 
        exist before about the 13th century; nor is it a function of chronological 
        age. The myth that the young tend to be revolutionaries arises from the 
        Left itself and serves the purpose of making the Revolution appear to 
        be a natural phenomenon.</p>
      <p>Instead, this revolutionary inversion has its origins in an early Christian 
        heresy (arrogating to itself the role of Christ the avenger) and has at 
        least three aspects:</p>
      <p>1-<em>Inversion of the perception of time</em></p>
      <p>Normal individuals, based on common sense, see the past as something 
        immutable and the future as something that can be changed (it is <em>contingent</em>, 
        as de Carvalho puts it).</p>
      <p>Not so the leftist revolutionary, who sees the utopian future as a goal 
        that eventually will be reached no matter what and the past as something 
        that can be changed, through reinterpretation (what we call &#8220;rewriting 
        history&#8221;), to accommodate it.</p>
      <p>One example the author gives of this is how Soviet propagandists reinterpreted 
        Dostoevsky, an anti-revolutionary of the first order. In his novel &#8220;Crime 
        and Punishment,&#8221; young revolutionary Raskolnikov kills his wealthy 
        elderly landlady as an act of solidarity with the poor class, in keeping 
        with his world view that ownership of private property is immoral and 
        that the revolutionary is entitled to take possession of it by any means 
        at his disposal. But Raskolnikov is caught and goes to jail where the 
        only book available to the prisoners is a Bible, which he reads, and is 
        converted to Christianity, abandoning his revolutionary ideology, which 
        he now understands as immoral.</p>
      <p>While fully aware of Dostoevsky&#8217;s anti-revolutionary mindset, the 
        early communists liked his novels and considered them too thoroughly Russian 
        to ban, so they simply reinterpreted him posthumously and declared that 
        his novels were written to highlight the need for more social justice. 
        Thus the Left reached back into time and manipulated the thoughts of a 
        man who would have been their adversary, making him posthumously a fellow 
        communist.</p>
      <p>2-<em>The inversion of morality</em></p>
      <p>De Carvalho points out that because the revolutionary (leftist) believes 
        implicitly in a future utopia where there will be no evil, this same revolutionary 
        believes that no holds should be barred in achieving that utopia. Thus, 
        his own criminal activities in achieving that goal are above reproach.</p>
      <p>The author cites Che Guevara, who said that the revolutionary is the 
        &#8220;highest rank of mankind.&#8221; Thus, armed with such moral superiority, 
        Che was able to cold-bloodedly murder his political enemies wholesale.</p>
      <p>Another example cited in the lecture is Karl Marx, who had an illicit 
        liaison with his maid and then, to keep bourgeois appearances, made his 
        son, the offspring of that liaison, live in the basement of his home, 
        never even introducing the boy to his brothers in wedlock. The boy was 
        never mentioned in the family and went into historical oblivion.</p>
      <p>De Carvalho compares this despicable behavior with the more noble conduct 
        of Brazilian landowners who had illegitimate children but made them heirs, 
        yet made no claims of moral superiority!</p>
      <p>To the revolutionary mind, it is normal that the revolutionary should 
        pay no mind to the bourgeois morality, because after all, nothing he does 
        can be construed as immoral, since the sum total of his actions hasten 
        the revolution when justice will prevail. This is why conservatives frequently 
        refer to the Left&#8217;s hypocrisy (for example, environmental champion 
        Al Gore&#8217;s 20-fold electricity consumption compared to yours and 
        mine).</p>
      <p>By contrast, the author shows that by the Left&#8217;s own definition 
        of &#8220;revolution,&#8221; the <em>American revolution</em> is <em>not</em> 
        <em>a</em> <em>revolution</em> at all because our founders were men who 
        held themselves (not just others) to high moral standards, and in no way 
        tried to usher in a novel experimental utopian system, basing their actions 
        and policies on older English traditions and common law, and modeling 
        our Republic on these tried and true common-sense precepts. </p>
      <p>3-<em>Inversion of subject and object</em></p>
      <p>When revolutionaries like Che, and Hitler&#8217;s operatives, for example, 
        killed innocent people, they would blame the people they killed for &#8220;making&#8221; 
        them do it by refusing to go along with their revolutionary notions. This 
        is one example the author gives of the inversion of subject and object.</p>
      <p>De Carvalho also points out a number of other inversions and makes many 
        fascinating points, but my purpose here is simply to clarify what the 
        Left really is, to stimulate thought and to predispose the reader to buy 
        his book when it comes out.</p>
      <p>You will be a better American for having read the writings of - a great 
        American.</p>
