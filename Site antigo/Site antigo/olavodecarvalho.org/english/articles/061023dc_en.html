            <p>Modern social science, with all its presumption and arrogance, 
              has failed to bring forth any discovery that ever approached, in 
              accuracy and explanatory power, the Hindu doctrine of the four castes, 
              whereof the Marxist conception of class struggle is but a remote 
              and caricatural imitation, hence deriving whatever impression of 
              truthfulness that it may make upon the foolish mind of the university 
              &#8220;intellectual proletariat.&#8221;</p>
            <p> For anyone who has taken the trouble to make a little study of 
              the Hindu explanation of the historical process, it is impossible, 
              on observing the sequence of power structures that succeed one another 
              throughout Western history, not to notice that it exactly repeats 
              the transition from the rule of <em>brahmanas</em> to that of <em>kshatriyas</em>, 
              from this to the rule of <em>vaishyas</em>, and from this to the 
              misrule of <em>shudras</em> and the confusion of pariahs which foreshadows 
              either the end of society or the return to the initial order.</p>
            <p> Here I shall briefly summarize that doctrine, not as it stands 
              in its pure original formulation, but in my adaptation of it, in 
              courses and lectures delivered since 1980, intended to make it more 
              flexible as an explanatory instrument of more recent historico-cultural 
              processes.</p>
            <p> The <em>brahmanas</em> are the intellectual caste, intent on the 
              search of spiritual knowledge and on the construction of a social 
              order that more or less reflects &#8220;the will of God&#8221;&#8212;the 
              laws determining the entire structure of reality.</p>
            <p> The <em>kshatriyas</em> are the warriors and aristocrats, who 
              over the structure of reality place the glorification of their own 
              dynastic traditions and the expansion of their military power.</p>
            <p> The <em>vaishyas</em> are the bourgeois and merchants. In everything 
              they seek profit and economic efficiency, which they illusorily 
              take as an actual power, ignoring the military and spiritual bases 
              of society and in the end being swiftly destroyed by the <em>shudras</em>. 
              These are the &#8220;proletarians,&#8221; in the Roman sense of 
              the term. Incapable of governing themselves, they matter only because 
              of the power of the many, because of the quantitative extension 
              of the &#8220;offspring.&#8221;</p>
            <p> The <em>brahmanas</em> fall because of their difficulty in remaining 
              faithful to their original spiritual intuition, entropically crumbled 
              into ever more insoluble and violent doctrinal disputes of a stifling 
              artificiality.</p>
            <p> The rise of aristocratic power, with the formation of modern nation 
              states, started directly out of the need to appease religious conflicts 
              by means of an external, political-military force.</p>
            <p> The <em>kshatriya</em> government falls because the aristocratic-military 
              establishment is essentially an expansionist and centralizing power, 
              which must rely on an ever-growing bureaucracy whose officials it 
              cannot keep up providing indefinitely, therefore having to collect 
              them from among the most talented members of both lower castes, 
              who are to be given necessary training for the exercise of their 
              new functions in the administration, in the judiciary, in the foreign 
              service, etc. Hence the origin of the modern &#8220;intelligentsia,&#8221; 
              as a byproduct of an educational system designed to shape officials 
              for the state: once the state bureaucracy is consolidated as a means 
              of social ascent, candidates for it are always in greater number 
              than the positions available, while, at the same time, schooling, 
              itself an instrument of selection, must necessarily reach much more 
              students than those to whom it can secure positions in the civil 
              service. The bureaucracy with which the <em>kshatriya</em> state 
              controls society thus becomes a time bomb. On the one hand, it goes 
              without saying that the bureaucratic intelligentsia soon lays hold 
              of the effective control of the state, dreaming of shaking off its 
              shoulders the yoke of an increasingly idle and costly aristocratic 
              caste. On the other hand, there is the throng of those rejected. 
              Their ambitions were aroused by schooling, frustrated by job selection. 
              They make up the contingent of what I have called &#8220;potential 
              bureaucracy&#8221;&#8212;the growing army of those individuals with 
              some training but no role. Their only possible place in society 
              is within the state, but the state has no room for them. They are 
              the revolutionary class <em>par excellence</em>, the leading character 
              in the adventure of modern times. Before long they will be dreaming 
              of a state that is molded to their needs. Until they manage to create 
              it, they busy themselves with endlessly chattering about all matters, 
              thus spreading their rancor and their frustrations throughout society 
              and, above all, adorning themselves with the prestige of the ancient 
              brahmanas, of whom they constitute the inverted caricature. The 
              &#8220;intellectuals&#8221; are the lay clergy of the Revolution. 
              If you have ever heard of PT, the Brazilian Workers&#8217; Party, 
              you know what I am talking about. Further on I shall come back to 
              it.</p>
            <p> On the other hand, the aristocratic state causes much expense 
              and cannot sustain itself indefinitely with the resources from a 
              traditional and artless agrarian economy; the economic expansion 
              requires the mobilization of specific skills which are those of 
              the <em>vaishyas</em>. Bankers and industrialists furnish the state 
              with a new economic basis, by regimenting <em>shudra</em> manpower 
              in proportions never dreamed of before and by replacing the ancient 
              agrarian economy with modern capitalism.</p>
            <p> It is at this moment&#8212;and under this aspect only&#8212;that 
              the difference between two systems of ownership of the means of 
              production becomes historically determinative, creating a peculiar 
              situation which Karl Marx will misleadingly project on the whole 
              course of history. But it is also clear that the rise of capitalism, 
              in itself, presents no risk to the aristocratic class, which easily 
              adapts to the new ways of amassing riches and, by means of marriages 
              and the award of titles of nobility, integrates into its ranks the 
              new rich who ascended without ancestral nobility, <em>sine nobilitate</em> 
              (<em>s. nob.</em> for short, hence the term &#8220;snob&#8221;). 
              To this adaptation there corresponds, politically, the transition 
              from the absolute monarchical state to the modern parliamentary 
              monarchy, a process that does not have to be violent or traumatic, 
              this being the case only in France because the excessive growth 
              of state bureaucracy had fatally occasioned an even greater growth 
              of the &#8220;potential bureaucracy&#8221; and had turned into sheer 
              revolutionary rancor the frustrated ambitions of the intelligentsia. 
              This very intelligentsia is what brought about the revolution. There 
              was not a single capitalist among the revolutionary leaders, and 
              the bourgeoisie, as was seen in England, never needed any revolution 
              to climb the social scale up to a status to which it was insistently 
              invited by the aristocracy itself. The concept of &#8220;bourgeois 
              revolution&#8221; is one of the greatest frauds in the history of 
              the social sciences. The elements in the potential bureaucracy, 
              in turn, cannot be defined economically. Their only common trait 
              was the education which distinguished them from the masses. They 
              came from all classes&#8212;the peasantry, the old clergy, the petty 
              bourgeoisie, the impoverished sectors of the aristocracy itself. 
              Theirs was not a unity of origin, but of social station and ambitions. 
              The true formula of their unity lay in the future: in the image 
              of the perfect state, invested with all the virtues which they themselves 
              thought to embody. Living off a self-glorifying fantasy, a psychological 
              compensation for their vexatious social position, it is no wonder 
              that they conceived of themselves as inheritors of the intellectual 
              authority of the <em>brahmanas</em> but also imagined that they 
              were the natural successors to the Church as spokesmen and keepers 
              of the poor and oppressed, namely the <em>shudras</em>. Everywhere 
              they speak on behalf of &#8220;science,&#8221; but also of &#8220;social 
              justice.&#8221; They imagine that they embody at the same time the 
              highest spiritual authority and the downtrodden rights of the lowest 
              caste. But just as there was no bourgeois in the vanguard of the 
              &#8220;bourgeois revolution,&#8221; there shall be no proletarians 
              among the leaders of the &#8220;proletarian revolution.&#8221; The 
              entire revolutionary sociology is an ideological fraud destined 
              to cover up the power of the &#8220;intellectuals.&#8221; These 
              are not a caste. They are an interface accidentally born of the 
              cancerous swelling of the bureaucracy, and for this very reason 
              they will fight to make it grow even more wherever they have acquired 
              the means to do so. They are, strictly speaking, pariahs&#8212;a 
              confused, deluded mixture of fragments from the speech of the various 
              castes. They are the pseudo-caste, with neither function nor axis, 
              sociopathic by birth and calling.</p>
            <p> The rise of the capitalist bourgeoisie is not a revolutionary 
              process. It is a long, complicated process of absortion and adaptation. 
              French capitalism was born weakly and has remained stunted because 
              of the Revolution, which came along with the bureaucratic expansion 
              and has continued to live off it until today, in a nation that is 
              the paradise <em>par excellence</em> of &#8220;intellectuals.&#8221; 
              Capitalism rather developed in England, where the aristocracy smoothly 
              adapted to their new capitalist functions, and in America, where, 
              the presence of the aristocracy of blood being sparse, that same 
              capitalist bourgeoisie invested itself with the heroic-aristocratic 
              ethos, generating a new <em>kshatriya</em> caste. I must observe 
              in passing that this transfiguration of the American bourgeoisie 
              into aristocracy&#8212;the most important and vigorous phenomenon 
              in modern history&#8212;would never have been possible without that 
              profound Christian impregnation of the new class which rendered 
              it, in contrast to the farce of the &#8220;intellectualls,&#8221; 
              the partial, distant, but authentic heir to the <em>brahmana</em> 
              authority.</p>
            <p> In the Hindu doctrine there is never a <em>shudra</em> government. 
              The <em>shudras</em> are, by definition, the ruled and not the rulers. 
              A guy may have been born a <em>shudra</em>, but on ascending to 
              positions of importance he is already an &#8220;intellectual&#8221; 
              (if Lula continued to be a lathe operator, he would be just a lathe 
              operator). What there can be is the government of intellectuals 
              passing themselves off as the <em>shudra</em> vanguard and, of course, 
              oppressing the <em>shudra</em> more than ever to make them form 
              the economic basis of a boundlessly expansive state bureaucracy.</p>
            <p> Economically, the <em>shudra</em> government, or socialism, has 
              verbal existence only. In 1921 Ludwig von Mises thoroughly demonstrated 
              that the completely nationalized economy is infeasible and that 
              therefore every self-styled socialist regime would never be more 
              than a capitalism disguised under the iron armor of state bureaucracy. 
              History has not ceased to prove him right ever since.</p>
            <p> From this brief exposition it is possible to draw some conclusions 
              that historical experience abundantly proves:</p>
            <p> 1. Wherever state bureaucracy becomes the predominant way of social 
              ascent, as in eighteenth-century France or in nineteenth-century 
              Russia, the potential bureaucracy tends to grow indefinitely and 
              become a generator of revolutionary pressures. Many modern nations 
              alleviate these pressures by creating an indefinite number of cultural 
              and academic sinecures in order to integrate and somehow &#8220;officialize&#8221; 
              the potential bureaucracy, but, on the one hand, this is a very 
              expensive palliative, one that can only be afforded by a powerful 
              capitalism, which precisely presupposes that the revolution be aborted 
              in time; on the other hand, the members of the officialized potential 
              bureaucracy may for a while be satisfied with their new roles in 
              capitalist society, but social ascent itself will eventually make 
              them even more presumptuous and arrogant. This explains why it is 
              precisely in those countries where intellectuals have the best living 
              conditions that they are the most resentful enemies of the society 
              which fosters and flatters them while, by compensation, they are 
              unable or perhaps unwilling to deal this society the final blow, 
              confining themselves to constituting a permanent structural corrosive 
              agent which on the whole is neutralized by technical progress and 
              capitalist growth.</p>
            <p>2. Where a potential bureaucracy as yet not perfectly officialized 
              holds in possession a political party as its main vehicle of social 
              integration, this party, embodying in its own eyes both the supreme 
              intellectual authority and the rights of every real or imagined 
              victim of social injustice, will necessarily place itself above 
              the laws and institutions, arrogating to itself every right and 
              every virtue and acknowledging no higher judgment than its own.</p>
            <p> 3. Every hope of integrating this party into the normal democratic 
              process will be repeatedly frustrated, for it will never construe 
              its participation in this process but as a temporary concession&#8212;in 
              itself repulsive&#8212;to those conditions which preclude the attainment 
              of its goals.</p>
            <p> 4. The conquest of total power will always be the goal and the 
              single raison d&#8217;&ecirc;tre of this party, which will attempt 
              all sorts of coup d&#8217;&eacute;tat and at the same time will 
              regard as a coup d&#8217;&eacute;tat any attempt, however timid 
              and limited, to prevent it from reaching its goals. Examples of 
              it abound in Brazil. The latest one is that in which the leaders 
              of the ruling party openly preach violent resistance to its possible 
              election defeat, while literally denouncing as a &#8220;coup d&#8217;&eacute;tat&#8221; 
              the simple journalistic disclosure of the money that they used in 
              a dirty trick against their opponent.</p>
            <p> 5. Since the primordial function of the revolutionary party, beneath 
              the most diverse ideological pretexts, is exactly to create a bureaucratic 
              state to serve its own members, it is normal and inevitable that 
              this party, once invested with state power, should regard the state 
              as property of its own, using it for ends of its own without finding 
              the least immorality in it. The potential bureaucracy is sociopathic 
              by birth and by definition; and its form of government, as soon 
              as there are conditions for it to be established, is and will always 
              be organized sociopathy.</p>
            <p> 6. The affinity between the revolutionary party and common banditism 
              is something more than a temporary conjunction of interests. From 
              the perspective of the potential bureaucracy, the only evil in the 
              world is that it does not have absolute power, is that there is 
              a society that transcends it and obeys it not. Every other evil, 
              if it weakens this society and facilitates the conquest of total 
              power by the revolutionary party, is a good. The solipsistic self-idolatry 
              of the gang boss and that of the revolutionary leader are one and 
              the same, with the slight difference that there is a little bit 
              of intellectual refinement in favor of the latter. It is ridiculous 
              to say that a party like PT &#8220;has turned&#8221; into a gang 
              of delinquents. It is a born delinquent.</p>
            <p> 7. The insistence of opponents on pretending that this party can 
              honorably participate in the normal political process will always 
              lead to conditions of &#8220;asymmetrical warfare,&#8221; in which 
              one side will have all the duties, and the other all the rights.</p>
            <p align="center"></p>
            <p align="center">*</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>PS&#8212;Those who have had the misfortune of being members by 
              birth of the potential bureaucracy cannot pursue but three courses 
              of life: (1) integrate into the revolutionary sham and brag everywhere 
              that they are benefactors of mankind, (2) fall into marginality, 
              mental illness, self-destruction, or banditism, (3) understand their 
              historical situation and struggle to escape from an essentially 
              grotesque social condition and to acquire through study and spiritual 
              self-discipline the dignity of the true status of brahmana, which 
              implies renouncing all political power and every psychosocial benefit 
              of participating in the revolutionary intelligentsia. Economically, 
              to make a livelihood from intellectual activity outside the revolutionary 
              scheme of mutual protection is a formidable challenge.</p>
            <p> The challenge to those who were born <em>vaishyas</em> is to resist 
              the siren song of revolution and to impose capitalism as a morally 
              superior way of life. This is impossible without the cultivation 
              of the <em>kshatriya</em> discipline and without the acceptance 
              of the heroic burdens of a new noble caste, which implies the absorption, 
              even if slight, of the <em>brahmana</em> legacy. The struggle in 
              the modern world is between <em>vaishyas</em> and the potential 
              bureaucrats&#8212;that is, between those who feed the state and 
              those who feed upon it. If the former let themselves be hypnotized 
              by revolutionary culture, they are finished, and with them the shudras 
              as well, who lose their status of free workers and become slaves 
              of the Communist bureaucracy.</p>
