            <p>The Russian psychologist Ivan Pavlov (1849-1936) demonstrated that 
              contradictory stimulation is the quickest and most efficient way 
              to break down the psychological defenses of an individual (or handful 
              of individuals), reducing him to a state of devoted credulity in 
              which he will accept as natural and true the most absurd commands 
              and the most incongruous opinions.
            <p>This works almost infallibly even when the stimuli are of a purely 
              cognitive order and without a great deal of emotional involvement 
              (contradictory sentences uttered in a camouflaged sequence so as 
              to create subconscious confusion). But it clearly works much better 
              if the subject is subjected to the impact of sufficiently strong 
              contradictory emotions to quickly create a state of intolerable 
              psychological discomfort. This discomfort itself serves as camouflage 
              because the victim does not have time to determine that the contradiction 
              comes from the source and not from within himself, so that guilt 
              and shame are added to the state of distress. The automatic reaction 
              that follows is the desperate search for a new equilibrium pattern, 
              that is, a broader feeling that seems to include, in a dialectic 
              synthesis, the two emotions initially experienced as contradictory 
              and which simultaneously alleviates the feeling of shame that the 
              individual experiences toward the source of stimulus, which at this 
              point he accepts as his critical observer or judge.</p>
            <p>If the reader examines the leftist discourse with some attention, 
              he will see that it manages to inspire in the public both fear and 
              compassion at the same time. This duality of feelings is not contradictory 
              in itself when each of the feelings is situated on a different plane, 
              as in the case of a Greek tragedy, where the spectators feel compassion 
              for the hero and fear of the cosmic machinery that oppresses him. 
              However, if the object of fear and compassion is the same, you simply 
              don't know how to react and enter a state of &quot;cognitive dissonance&quot; 
              (term of the psychologist Leon Festinger), a state of mental atonia 
              that predisposes to passive subservience.</p>
            <p>I say fear and compassion, although these are never simple and 
              unequivocal emotions but rather complex emotional webs that trap 
              the victim at the same time, making him incapable of verbally expressing 
              the situation and suffocating him in a murky atmosphere of confusion 
              and impotence.</p>
            <p>In revolutionary politics, contradictory stimulation assumes the 
              form of terrorist attacks intended to intimidate a population, accompanied 
              simultaneously by intense sensitization campaigns showing the sufferings 
              of the revolutionaries and the poor population that they nominally 
              represent. The destruction of farms by the Landless Movement is 
              an apt example. The assaulted class is paralyzed between two sets 
              of contradictory feelings - on the one hand, fear and rage, or the 
              impulse to react, to flee or seek protection; on the other hand, 
              extorted compassion, guilt and the impulse to ask forgiveness of 
              the aggressor.</p>
            <p>It is no coincidence that the first scientific description of this 
              mechanism was the work of an eminent Russian psychologist. The use 
              of contradictory stimulation was already a tradition in the revolutionary 
              movement when Ivan Pavlov started to investigate the subject precisely 
              during the years in which the Russian Revolution was under preparation. 
              His studies were immediately absorbed by the Communist leadership, 
              which began using them to elevate revolutionary manipulation of 
              the mind to the level of a highly precise, efficient social engineering 
              technique capable of extensive operations with impressive control 
              of the results.</p>
            <p>Over the last four decades, with the transition of the revolutionary 
              movement from the old hierarchic structure to the flexible organization 
              in informal &quot;networks&quot; with immense financial support, 
              the use of contradictory stimulation ceased to be the exclusive 
              domain of the Communist Party and spread throughout all sorts of 
              auxiliary organizations - NGOs, media enterprises, international 
              organisms and cultural entities - the revolutionary nature of which 
              was not declared ex-professo , making the tracing of the unified 
              strategy throughout the whole a very complex problem, transcending 
              the horizon of consciousness of the usual entrepreneurial and political 
              leaderships and requiring the intervention of specialized studies. 
              In general, social libertarians and conservatives are formidably 
              under-equipped to cope with the situation. They endeavor to win 
              over the public by logical arguments in favor of democracy and market 
              economy, when the actual battlefield is situated far below this, 
              in an obscure area of irrational emotions controlled by the adversary 
              with all the latest refinements of rationality and science.</p>
            <p>In future articles I will illustrate the use of contradictory stimulation 
              by various &quot;social movements&quot;: feminist, gay agenda, abortion, 
              atheist, environmentalist, etc.</p>
