      <p>According to the well-known Brazilian philosopher and journalist Olavo 
        de Carvalho, since 1964 there is under way in Brazil a well planned and 
        highly successful scheme aiming at establishing a communist regime in 
        the country. This view was expressed in an interview in August 21st, last 
        year, to Gaúcha Broadcasting Station, in Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil. 
      <p> The philosopher declared that, in Brazil, following the well known tactics 
        devised by Lenin and refined by the Italian revolutionary Antonio Gramsci, 
        many public offices, labor unions, public schools, the media and almost 
        all organizations that influences public opinion have been infiltrated 
        by reliable members of left wing political parties, mostly communists.
      <p> In all sectors of the government, as well as in the congress and houses 
        of representatives of all 26 states and in about five thousand municipalities 
        of the country, most politicians came from former leftist movements, many 
        of them ex-terrorists, including high rank officials. Even the president 
        Cardoso is a former leftist who lived in exile for many years.
      <p> Practically all unions are ruled by fanatical communists. The number 
        of infiltrated agents among newspapermen and teachers is staggering. Especially 
        in public schools history is taught under the Marxist point of view and 
        tapes dealing with class struggle, agrarian reform, colonialism, imperialism 
        and other communist themes are exhibited to the students, who are asked 
        to make compositions on these subjects.
      <p> According to the philosopher Olavo de Carvalho, an ex-communist, this 
        strategy of gradually changing the values of the society follows the ideas 
        of the Marxist theoretician and founder of the Italian communist party, 
        Antonio Gramsci. The strategy is to prepare the public mind in such a 
        way that the transition to a communist society would happen naturally, 
        in a painless way. Evolution, instead of revolution. The pain will be 
        felt only when the communists reach power and the bloodshed begins, as 
        has always been the case.
      <p> Even the last 1988 Brazil’s constitution, promulgated prior to the fall 
        of the Berlin Wall, has been put to the service of Marxian principles, 
        and grants amazing privileges to the Brazilian Nomenklature (highly paid 
        public officials, in the former USSR), such as the privilege of public 
        servants to increase their own lavish salaries; the right not to be fired, 
        simultaneously with the right to make strikes; public pensions ten times 
        bigger than that of the private sector, and so forth. Instead of being 
        an instrument for protecting the citizen, the leftist oriented constitution 
        really creates privileged castes and protects them from the legitimate 
        claims of the people.
      <p> In Brazil, communists are acting in three fronts. The labor union CUT 
        has infiltrated members in the great majority of unions and is always 
        supporting strikes and every kind of mass movements and riots. 
      <p> There is also the rural branch, the MST (Landless Movement), that follows 
        Mao Tsé Tung’s doctrines in performing guerrilla actions against farmers 
        and ranchers in accordance with the basic communist program of abolishing 
        the property right. The so-called “landless” peasants, heavily infiltrated 
        by professional members of communist parties, are invading farms and even 
        public organs, under the accommodating eyes of the government, who is 
        buying huge areas and distributing them among the landless peasants, besides 
        money and other benefits. Money given by the government is used to fund 
        more guerrilla actions.
      <p> The MST uses guerrilla tactics learned in Cuba and Nicaragua, such as 
        using human shields (putting children and old people in front on the mob, 
        to be hit first by the police, with propaganda dividends; executing detailed 
        invasion techniques planned months in advance; invading farms at night, 
        before holidays (to avoid judicial measures) and using a lot of vehicles, 
        most of which were bought with money given by the government. The invasions 
        may involve thousands of members, led by highly trained communist agents 
        and they make tents, destroy fences and even sow the soil as rapidly as 
        possible.
      <p> Urban violence is exploding in big cities, and all types of criminals 
        may count on the protection of leftists political parties, who consider 
        them their allies in the fight against the “bourgeois” (the capitalists). 
        The alleged human rights are always claimed in favor of bandits, never 
        to their victims. Part of the Catholic church, the so-called Progressive 
        Church, adopted a Marxian approach to social problems and has been used 
        as “dupes” (useful innocents) by the leftist wing. 
      <p> The movement has also its political branch, the PT (nicknamed “Labor 
        Party”), led by the charismatic Lula, an ex-trade-unionist. Trained in 
        Cuba on terrorism, Lula, who almost won the presidency of the country 
        in the last three elections, is expected to run again, this time with 
        more odds in his favor, due to the great success of leftist parties in 
        the last municipal election, held in October, 2000. The PT won elections 
        in almost 200 cities, including the most important city of the countrySão 
        Paulo. The winning São Paulo mayor, who is from an aristocratic traditional 
        family of the state (Matarazzo), celebrated her victory offering a banquet 
        to hundreds of beggars and urchins from the streets of São Paulo. 
      <p> Lula celebrated the victory taking about two hundred of his comrades 
        in a visit to his mastermind, Fidel Castro, in Cuba. Many of Lula’s followers, 
        including the president of the party, have already been before on the 
        island, to be trained in guerrilla and terrorism techniques. Lula even 
        offered Fidel Castro a title of Doctor Honoris Causa from the University 
        of Campinas, in the second greatest city of the Sate of São Paulo, which 
        is an institution well known for the its concentration of leftist adherents.
      <p> So far Brazil has survived a series of attempts of taking over the power 
        by the communists, in 1935, in 1964 and in 1968. A recent book by Professor 
        Denise Rollemberg, from the University of Rio de Janeiro State, to be 
        published this year in academic spheres, focus on three attempts by Fidel 
        Castro to settle guerrilla movements in Brazil. Severe measures, including 
        the establishing of a authoritarian regime had to be implemented in order 
        to prevent the taking over of the government by the left wing revolutionaries.
      <p> Signs of the “painless” communization of the country are visible only 
        to trained eyes. The top heavy government is already capturing almost 
        one third of the GDP as taxes, most of which are distributed among the 
        members of the local Nomenklature, scarcelly returning as benefits to 
        the tax payers. The number of public servants is always on the increase 
        and new competitive examinations are advertised almost daily in the newspapers. 
      <p> Hundreds of new public employees are also being admitted by politicians, 
        which means that bureaucracy is increasing while the productive sector 
        is dwindling. To meet increased expenses, the government keeps elevating 
        taxes, which are a deterrent to economic development. Each time, there 
        is less people producing wealth and more people in the payroll of the 
        government, as in communist countries. At the same time, tax collecting 
        organs from the government, eager for money, furiously chase evading tax 
        payers, most of them evading tax payments because it is impossible to 
        survive paying all the almost sixty different taxes that are levied by 
        the government. This will result in the closing of many business enterprises, 
        whose former employers will have to look for positions in the government, 
        resulting in an even greater decrease of the productive sector.
      <p> The federal government made some privatization but many privatized organs 
        have been bought mainly by public servant’s pension funds. The privatized 
        companies, formerly belonging to the federal government, now are owned 
        mostly by public servants pension funds.
      <p> Some foreign investors, afraid of the progress of leftist political 
        parties, avoid making investments in the country and many local entrepreneurs 
        are planning to leave the country in the event that the communist party, 
        the PT, led by Lula, reaches the presidency. Lula is clearly against privatizing 
        programs and states that he intends to nationalize foreign companies, 
        to revert privatized companies to the government and levy heavy taxes 
        on “great fortunes”. Of course he has the intention of not paying both 
        the internal as the foreign debt.
      <p> The philosopher Olavo de Carvalho stresses that, as usual, leftist parties 
        preach one thing and practice another. Publicly they praise democracy, 
        freedom, social justice, equality and economic progress. However, if we 
        look at their program, available through the internet, it will be obvious 
        that their intentions are exactly the contrary. Recently, before going 
        to pay homage to Fidel Castro, Lula declared that people who think that 
        he and his party is abandoning former communist ideas are completely wrong. 
      <p> Their ultimate goal still is to establish a dictatorship of one party, 
        with absolute power in their hands and complete restriction to any demonstration 
        of individualism. The party’s program, as expected, favors all forms of 
        collectivism. 
      <p> They have not moved one inch from their original Marxist ideas. They 
        even admit that their intention is to resort to violence in order to reach 
        their goals of socializing the country. The party program also declares 
        that the PT party is just a branch of the international socialist program.
      <p> Though all over the world communism is seen as a black page of history, 
        marked by bloodshed and economic failure, in Brazil it is being hailed 
        as the solution of all problems of the country, strictly in accordance 
        to Marxian canons. Certainly the communists will not succeed in establishing 
        a clone of soviet or Cuban regimes, but surely they will lead Brazil to 
        very serious social, political and economic crisis, with dire consequences 
        to all citizens.
