      <p style="text-align: left;">As Latin American governments
continue marching toward ever-closer
&#8220;integration&#8221; under transnational bodies like the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/world-news/south-america/item/10517-south-american-union-selects-socialist-leaders">socialist-dominated</a>
Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), regional leaders are now
calling for what essentially amounts to a continental police force. The
authoritarian regime ruling Venezuela, meanwhile, is attempting to
erect a new hemispheric &#8220;human rights commission&#8221; that excludes the
U.S. government. <br>
      <br>
During a ministerial UNASUR meeting held in Cartagena last week, senior
officials representing the 12 member governments demanded the creation
of a regional "Council for Public Safety, Justice and Cooperation."
According to the member-states&#8217; Ministers in attendance &#8212; Justice,
Interior, Defense, and Foreign Relations &#8212; transnational crime
represents among the most serious problems facing the region. <br>
      <br>
"One of the major threats to democracy today comes from the power of
organized crime that establishes or seeks to establish, in some places,
a sort of parallel power and tries to control portions of the state,"
      <a href="http://www.andina.com.pe/Ingles/Noticia.aspx?id=j6NnMuc1f98=" target="_blank">explained</a> Peru's Foreign Minister Rafael
Roncagliolo. "Organized crime
not only represents a major transnational economic power but also a
threat to the states."<br>
      <br>
There are numerous different criminal problems ravishing Latin America,
officials explained during the summit. The trafficking of drugs,
humans, and weapons, for example, are among the most serious threats.
Other criminal enterprises that officials said should be tackled
jointly include illegal mining, money laundering, corruption,
cybercrime, and more. <br>
      <br>
"Crime knows nothing about borders, and the struggle against it will
only be effective if it is based on cooperation from all countries,"
      <a href="http://www.cadenagramonte.cu/english/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=10776:unasur-crime-jeopardizes-security-in-south-america&amp;catid=3:world&amp;Itemid=14" target="_blank">said</a> Colombian Defense Minister Juan Carlos Pinzon
during a speech at
the summit, urging his counterparts throughout South America and
various government ministries to create new regional bodies to oversee
the efforts. In addition to Colombia, the regional body includes
Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Ecuador, Chile, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru,
Suriname, Uruguay and Venezuela.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
Speaking to reporters after the UNASUR meetings, Pinzon reiterated his
demands and claimed that there was popular support for the
controversial scheme. &#8220;There is now a broad consensus in South America
to address transnational crime in a coordinated manner," the Defense
chief was <a href="http://colombiareports.com/colombia-news/news/23882-unasur-seeks-to-create-council-to-fight-transnational-crime.html" target="_blank">quoted as saying</a>. It was not immediately clear
whether he was
referring to a &#8220;consensus&#8221; among government officials or the people of
the region.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
According to news reports, the summit concluded by calling for the
formation of a working group to develop laws and an &#8220;action plan&#8221; to
create the new regional security body. Before becoming official,
however, the proposed council must be approved at an upcoming gathering
of UNASUR member presidents this July.<br>
      <br>
Though not formally discussed during last week&#8217;s summit, the Hugo
Chavez regime in Venezuela took the opportunity to push for a new
regional &#8220;human rights commission.&#8221; Under the proposal, which could
take shape through any number of transnational integration entities
developing in Latin America, the <a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/world-news/south-america/item/10534-chavez-threatens-banks-and-land-owners-refusing-his-orders" target="_blank">socialist ruler</a> would consider leaving
the &#8220;Inter-American Commission on Human Rights&#8221; because of the U.S.
government&#8217;s influence over it.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
&#8220;We are hoping that through UNASUR, through CELAC [<a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/world-news/south-america/item/10533-new-americas-group-includes-cuba-not-us-china-cheers" target="_blank">Community of Latin
American and Caribbean States</a>], we can quickly ... create
organizations
linked to the issue of human rights,&#8221; Venezuela's Foreign Minister
Nicolas Maduro was <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/venezuela-says-latin-america-should-create-human-rights-commission-exclude-united-states/2012/05/03/gIQA3lN5zT_story.html" target="_blank">quoted as saying</a> by the Associated Press,
apparently
suggesting a push for a novel understanding of the term human rights.
The U.S. government &#8211; Chavez calls it the &#8220;Yankee Empire&#8221; - would not
be invited to participate.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
Meanwhile, Colombia, which has traditionally been perceived as a
bulwark against the surging <a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/world-news/south-america/item/10497-resurgent-communism-in-latin-america" target="_blank">&#8220;pink tide&#8221; socialist domination of the
continent</a>, is now cheerleading for the integration process, too.
But as
the national government continues to surrender sovereignty to the
rapidly expanding continental apparatus, the Colombian people will
undoubtedly find themselves increasingly governed by the region&#8217;s
totalitarian-minded regimes. <br>
      <br>
Ironically, most of the Marxist narco-terrorist groups waging a
decades-long war against Colombia, including the infamous Revolutionary
Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), are closely affiliated with
governments in the region. The government of Brazil &#8211; a key driver in
the expansion of the regional left and the &#8220;integration&#8221; process - has
even been <a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/world-news/south-america/item/10527-corruption-brazil-sheltering-wanted-marxist-terrorist" target="_blank">sheltering FARC leader Francisco Antonio Cadena</a>
(also known
as Oliverio Medina) despite his being wanted by Colombian authorities
on terrorism charges.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
&#8220;The pro-communist government in Brazil did not only assure political
asylum to Mr. Medina, but even gave a public office to his wife. This
generous gift was an initiative of [current Brazilian President] Mrs.
Dilma Roussef, a member of [former President] Lula&#8217;s Cabinet at that
time,&#8221; acclaimed Brazilian author and philosopher <a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/world-news/south-america/item/10496-olavo-de-carvalho-on-communism-in-latin-america" target="_blank">Prof. Olavo de
Carvalho</a>, an expert on the communist resurgence in the region, told
The
New American in an e-mail. &#8220;She denied the fact, but later some
hard-nosed journalists found her signature on the appointment decree.&#8221;<br>
      <br>
Throughout Latin America, a shadowy alliance of socialist and communist
political parties, criminal groups, and other organizations are seizing
power under the innocuously named <a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/world-news/south-america/item/10497-resurgent-communism-in-latin-america" target="_blank">&#8220;Foro de Sao Paulo&#8221;</a> (FSP), or Sao
Paulo Forum. Formed by former Brazilian President Luis Inacio &#8220;Lula&#8221; da
Silva, communist dictator Fidel Castro, the Sandinistas, and other
prominent characters, the network has remained largely below the radar
despite controlling some two thirds of the region&#8217;s governments. <br>
      <br>
But according to Prof. Carvalho - who played a crucial role in publicly
exposing the FSP &#8211; Colombia&#8217;s Marxist guerillas still maintain close
ties to Brazil&#8217;s ruling elite. &#8220;The alliance between the Workers&#8217; Party
(Lula&#8217;s party) and the FARC is not a matter of conjecture, but an
absolute certainty, since Mr. Lula presided over the São Paulo Forum
for many years in close association with Manuel Marulanda, the high
commander of the Colombian guerilla,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;The fact is
confirmed by the proceedings of the Forum general assemblies.&#8221; <br>
      <br>
Still, despite the well-known nexus between Marxist terror networks and
politics in the region, even Colombia&#8217;s new President Juan Manuel
Santos threw his support behind UNASUR&#8217;s effort to erect the new
continental crime-fighting body. "Only together can we end
transnational organized crime,&#8221; Santos was quoted as saying after the
summit. &#8220;Criminals must know that there will not be a single place
where they can hide when nations come together."<br>
      <br>
UNASUR, which officially came into force last year, has been quickly
expanding its role in the region. Modeled after the European Union, the
entity and its affiliates have already created a dizzying array of
integration schemes on everything from military cooperation and
security to health and energy. And last year, <a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/world-news/south-america/item/10517-south-american-union-selects-socialist-leaders" target="_blank">two socialists were
selected</a> to become the continental body&#8217;s first leaders &#8211; one from
Colombia, the other from Venezuela.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
After witnessing the spectacular crisis surrounding the Euro in recent
years, Latin American governments <a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/world-news/south-america/item/10524-with-euro-crisis-south-american-union-slows-currency-scheme" target="_blank">decided to put their own
single-currency scheme on hold.</a> But the EU has already created its
own
fledgling law enforcement agency known as Europol, and Latin American
governments seem determined to follow in Europe&#8217;s footsteps. <br>
      <br>
UNASUR and other regional entities like CELAC and the overtly socialist
ALBA, meanwhile, continue to <a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/world-news/south-america/item/10497-resurgent-communism-in-latin-america" target="_blank">rapidly expand and consolidate power</a> at
the expense of national sovereignty. The process is often helped along
by the U.S. government &#8212; albeit quietly &#8212; despite Latin American claims
that empowering the transnational bodies will <a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/index.php/world-news/south-america/item/10535-latin-america-debates-drug-legalization-obama-demands-more-war-on-drugs" target="_blank">reduce American influence
there</a>. <br>
      <br>
Meanwhile, <a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/world-news/south-america/item/10497-resurgent-communism-in-latin-america" target="_blank">Russia</a> and <a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/world-news/south-america/item/10533-new-americas-group-includes-cuba-not-us-china-cheers" target="_blank">China</a> are becoming increasingly influential in
the hemisphere, pouring massive investment into the region while
cooperating closely with national governments. Leaders like Chavez have
hailed the developments, claiming to be creating what he <a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/world-news/south-america/item/10497-resurgent-communism-in-latin-america" target="_blank">touted as</a> a
&#8220;New World Order&#8221; during a trip to Beijing. <br>
      <br>
Critics, however, are not quite as enthusiastic - and many are fighting
back, arguing that what the region needs is more freedom, not more
government or more integration. The new order, opponents say, will
almost certainly be darker than the old; especially for the populations
of the relatively liberty-minded nations like Costa Rica and Chile that
are still standing. <br>
