      <p align="center"> <i>OLA</i><i>VO DE CARVALHO<br>
        </i>Sent to <i>Época’s </i>newsroom in Oct. 29, 2001, for the edition 
        of Nov. 3  – Not published </p>
      <p align="center">Translated by Assunção Medeiros<br>

      <p>“We must make use of all sort of stratagems, maneuvers, illegal methods, 
        covers and subterfuge”, wrote Lenin in “The Left, Childhood Disease of 
        Communism”. It is a general formula of the conduct of the left. But the 
        immediate context clarifies even more its sense and its current validity: 
        Lenin said these words when he was getting ready to launch NEP, the policy 
        of opening markets that led the world to believe that socialism had lost 
        its brutish and revolutionary vocation, disarmed western prevention and 
        attracted to the URSS bulky foreign investments that were afterwards, 
        naturally, taken over by force. </p>
      <p>This was the first of an endless series of  “light” camouflages that 
        socialism has been adopting to this day. </p>
      <p>And Lenin would conclude: “When we have conquered the masses through 
        a reasonable attitude, then we shall apply the offensive tactics.”</p>
      <p>Since then it became the praxis in the communist parties to keep at the 
        same time two lines of action, a violent and a pacifist one, a radical 
        and a moderate, alternating its exhibition on stage according to the conveniences 
        of the moment. Alternating also the modality of the relationship between 
        these two lines, that can sometimes be a partnership, sometimes competition 
        or antagonism, in a way that the movement would at times look weak and 
        divided, and at other times united and strong. Anatoliy Golitsyn, in his 
        book “New Lies for Old”, showed that, in Soviet politics, this last altering 
        reflected the rhythm of progression of the revolutionary strategy, according 
        to the advice of Sun-Tzu: “Show yourself weak when you are strong, and 
        strong when you are weak”.</p>
      <p>This premeditated ambiguity can be personified in separate figures, which 
        represent simultaneously the two facets of the party, like – in the state 
        of Rio Grande do Sul – you can see in Tarso Genro and Miguel Rosetto, 
        corresponding, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, to Harlequin and Pierrot, or to 
        Laurel and Hardy. This mechanism can also appear as the opportunistic 
        adaptation to the changes of the historical rhythm, in such a way that 
        the aggressive and unpleasant tactics are put aside as inadequate to the 
        new times, without ever being, because of that, morally condemned. But 
        it can also be manifested as ambiguity in the strict sense of the term, 
        that is, as a double-meaning discourse. When Mr. Aloysio Nunes Ferreira 
        Filho declares that  “he does not know” whether today he would still make 
        use of the violent action in which he was involved in the seventies, at 
        the same time that he praises as heroes the ones who took part in it, 
        what he is saying is that he will return to them as soon as he feels it 
        is the proper moment to do so. </p>
      <p>It is not a question of morality, but of opportunity. Such is, therefore, 
        the performance we can expect from him in the Ministry of Justice: “When 
        we have conquered the masses through a reasonable attitude, then we shall 
        apply offensive tactics.” The only hope that communist violence does not 
        return to afterwards accuse as violent the reaction of its victims is 
        that the “reasonable attitude” does not reach the desired results. And 
        this depends on the timely decoding of each ambiguous word of Mr. Nunes 
        Ferreira as the latent threat they are. There is also the very remote 
        hypothesis that he becomes aware of the Leninist malice of his conduct 
        and, with no wasting of time, repents of his own past. Repents of it not 
        only as his past, but as a focus of infection that must be cauterized 
        so it never gets inflamed again, in the very same and exact sense which 
        I examine my own communist militancy, not with the nostalgia of someone 
        that pats the head of his extinct youth, but with the realism of someone 
        who confesses a grave moral error. </p>
      <p>Benedetto Croce distinguished moral repentance – which condemns the act 
        itself as intrinsically evil – from “economic repentance” – which does 
        not abjure the act, but merely its undesirable consequences: a thief is 
        ashamed of having robbed, another of not having been able to escape the 
        police. Even the pure moral repentance does not guarantee the criminal 
        will never act again. But the economic repentance is almost a guarantee 
        of reincidence.</p>
