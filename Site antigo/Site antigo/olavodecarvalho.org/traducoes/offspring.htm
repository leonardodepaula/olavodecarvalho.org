      <p><b>For each homicide they denounce, they were accomplices of other 49</b></p>
      <p>The Brazilians that got guerrilla training in Cuba have not only become 
        the forefront of Cuban strategy abroad, but also, obviously, supporters 
        of Fidel Castro’s regime inside Cuba itself. Received there with honors, 
        kept with money from the State, they had very clear functions and activities 
        in the Fidelian power scheme, some as officers of military intelligence, 
        others as symbols for the legitimization and figures for the propaganda 
        of the regime, a role that many still play with cynical devotion. </p>
      <p>As any other helper and beneficiary of a dictatorship, they have made 
        themselves accomplices of the crimes committed by it, in the same sense 
        and the very same proportion they accuse of partnership in the crimes 
        of the national dictatorship any individual, here or abroad, that in any 
        way supported the military regime or received favors from it. Morally 
        the only difference there can be between one partnership and the other 
        resides in the magnitude of the crimes practiced by the respective dictatorships. 
        But this comparison is not at all favorable to those that hold today the 
        monopoly of the right to accuse. </p>
      <p>Brazil in the dictatorial period did not have more than two thousand 
        political prisoners. Cuba had a hundred thousand. For each left-wing militant 
        arrested by the DOI-Codi, by Dops, in Ilha Grande, 50 other Cubans were 
        thrown in the political prisons of Havana, with the solicitous political 
        and moral complicity of these Brazilians. And what about the dead? The 
        Brazilian dictatorship made 300 victims; the Cuban 17 thousand. For each 
        Brazilian communist killed by the military, 50 Cuban dissidents died. 
      </p>
      <p>The difference is not only in quantity. It affects the nature itself 
        of the crimes. Seventeen thousand deaths in a population circa 14 times 
        smaller than Brazil’s can already be considered genocide, the methodic 
        and systematic obliteration of a group, of a class. Genocide with a detail 
        a great deal more pernicious: in Cuba, since the escape of Batista, there 
        was no internal armed resistance. The Brazilian dictatorship killed guerrillas 
        and terrorists. Cuba, with the support of the same guerrillas and terrorists, 
        killed unarmed citizens, peaceful persons that represented no danger at 
        all, most of them for frivolous reasons, many times because of a simple 
        search for a better life. </p>
      <p>If it can be considered justifiable for them to denominate “offspring 
        of dictatorship” anyone who collaborated with the military regime, with 
        the same severity and fairness the ones that were beneficiaries of Cuban 
        help must be called  “offspring of genocide”. </p>
      <p>But 17 thousand were only the ones who died inside Cuban territory. I 
        am not counting those that armed troops – instructed and financed by the 
        government in Havana, co-sisters of the Brazilian guerrilla – killed in 
        Peru, in Nicaragua, in Colombia. They are 80 thousand in total: for each 
        communist killed in Brazil, their comrades killed more than 49 non-communists 
        in the continent. And they continue to kill. Their sufferings, besides 
        being well and fully compensated through indemnification, were already 
        avenged 49 times over. With what kind of moral authority, therefore, do 
        these people raise their accusing fingers against these “offspring of 
        dictatorship”? Regardless of the intrinsic power of these facts and numbers, 
        the leftist malice will try to neutralize them, alleging that they come 
        out of the mouth of an anticommunist. But that would be to invert cause 
        and effect. I do not think this way because I am anticommunist: I became 
        anticommunist because I became aware of these things. </p>
      <p>Even so, I kept these things to myself for years on end, being afraid 
        of jeopardizing people that one day I called “comrades”. If I can be accused 
        of anything, then it is of this craven listlessness of which I finally 
        rid myself, but that made me tarry overlong in telling the truth.  Many, 
        knowing all this as well as I did, still live to hide it under word games, 
        not to protect others, but to protect themselves and the advantages they 
        enjoy today, be it as government officials, be it as opposition leaders. 
        This is all their morals are made of: repressed guilt, transmuted into 
        an insatiable hunger for retaliation and compensation. </p>
      <p>Of course that the crimes of the military dictatorship must be denounced, 
        investigated, and punished – but not by this kind of people. Not by this 
        scum.</p>
