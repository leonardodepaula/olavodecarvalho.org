      <p align="left">The general understanding of the term ‘higher education’ 
        is that it basically means the training for the well-paid professions. 
        From this concept we may conclude, without the slightest chance for error, 
        that every normal human being is able to receive it and that any elitism 
        whatsoever would be unjust, even when the case is not one of intentional 
        discrimination but of unequal distribution of luck. However, if we are 
        to understand by the name of ‘higher education’ the overcoming of the 
        intellectual limitations of the environment, the access to a universal 
        perspective of things, and the realisation of the highest spiritual qualities 
        a human being possesses, then we will find that many candidates have a 
        personal impairment that, sooner or later, will end up excluding them 
        and assuring that ‘higher education’ – in the strong and not in the administrative 
        sense – continues to be, by their own right, a privilege of few.</p>
      <p align="left">This impairment, thanks be to God, is not of economic, social, 
        ethnic or biological order. It is one of those human evils which, like 
        cancer and matrimonial quarrels, is more or less fairly and equally distributed 
        among classes, races, and genders. It is the only kind of imperfection 
        that could justly be invoked as the cornerstone of an elitist selection. 
        Anyway, that would be totally unnecessary, because it makes a selection 
        by itself, and in such a natural and spontaneous way that the excluded 
        cannot even imagine what they have lost, and are actually quite happy 
        about their situation. Thus, perfect harmony reigns among the happy few 
        and the unhappy many, safeguarded by the impassable distance which separates 
        them.</p>
      <p align="left">The impairment to which I refer is not material, nor is 
        it quantifiable. Statistics do not include it in their calculations, and 
        the government completely ignores it. Nonetheless it exists, has a name 
        and has been known for more than two millennia. A competent mind can recognise 
        its presence immediately, by an intuitive act of perception as simple 
        as differentiating day and night.</p>
      <p align="left">The Greeks called it <i>apeirokalia</i>. It means simply 
        ‘the lack of experience of the most beautiful things’. By this term it 
        was understood that the individual who, in certain stages of his development, 
        had been deprived of certain interior experiences that woke on him the 
        desire for beauty, goodness, and truth, would never be able to understand 
        the conversations of the sages, no matter how much effort he put in learning 
        Sciences, Letters and Rhetoric. Plato, for instance, would say that this 
        man is a prisoner of the cave. Aristotle, in a more technical language, 
        would say that rites are not intended for the transmission of specific 
        teachings to men, but to cause on their soul a <i>deep impression</i>. 
        Anyone who is aware of the importance Aristotle gives to the imaginative 
        impressions will understand the extreme seriousness of what he means: 
        these impressions performed upon the soul an illuminating and structuring 
        impact. In their absence, intelligence obscurely drifts about the multitude 
        of sensible data, without grasping the symbolic nexus which, bridging 
        the gap between abstractions and reality, prevents our reasoning from 
        dissolving into a maddening combinatory of empty syllogisms – the pedant 
        expressions of the impotence to know.</p>
      <p align="left">Of course, the inner experiences which Aristotle refers 
        to are not exclusively granted by ‘rites’ in the strict and technical 
        understanding of the term. Theatre and poetry also can open souls to an 
        inflow of the above. To music – to certain music – we cannot deny the 
        power to generate a similar effect. The simple contemplation of nature, 
        a providential happening, or, for more sensitive souls, even certain states 
        of loving rapture, when associated with a strong moral appeal (remember 
        Raskolnikov, before Sonia, in <i>Crime and Punishment</i>), can put the 
        soul in a certain state of bliss that frees it from the cave and from 
        <i>apeirokalia</i>.</p>
      <p align="left">However, it is much more likely that the most intense experiences 
        a man may have during his life will drive him away from what Aristotle 
        had in mind. For what characterises the life-giving impression the philosopher 
        mentions is precisely the impossibility to separate, in their content, 
        truth, goodness and beauty. From Plato to Leibniz, there was not a single 
        philosopher worthy of the name who did not most emphatically proclaim 
        the unity of these three aspects of Being. And here begins the problem: 
        most men never had an experience in which beauty, goodness and truth did 
        not appear separated by tremendous abysses. Such men are the victims of 
        <i>apeirokalia</i> – and among them we may count some of the most influential 
        intellectuals in the world of today.</p>
      <p align="left">Unhappily, the number of these victims seems to be destined 
        to increase. Back in 1918, Max Weber already pointed the loss of the unity 
        of ethical-religious, aesthetical and cognitive values as prominent traces 
        of the time. Goodness, beauty and truth became more and more distant every 
        day, and because of that</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p align="left"> <i>&quot;the most sublime values have retreated from 
          the public life, either to the transcendent world of mystic life, or 
          to the fraternity of personal and direct human relationships... It is 
          not by chance that today, only in the small and intimate circles, in 
          personal human situations, there remains something that may correspond 
          to the prophetic spirit (</i>pneuma<i>) which in ancient times would 
          sweep large communities like a fire&quot;.</i>
      </blockquote>
        <p align="left">The two fortresses of the sublime that Weber mentions did 
        not last for long: mystic life, harassed by the tide of fake esoterism 
        that stole its language and prestige, ended up recoiling to silence, off 
        the mainstream, in order not to be contaminated by profane babble. Intimacy, 
        assaulted by the media, violated by the State’s interference, turned into 
        the object of hysterical exhibitionism and sadic sneaking, disowned of 
        its language by the commercial and ideological exploration of its symbols, 
        simply no longer exists.</p>
      <p align="left">The whole of literature in the twentieth century reflects 
        this state of affairs: first the ‘incommunicability’ of the egos, then 
        the suppression of the ego itself – ‘character dissolution’. But many 
        things happened since Weber. Nearing the end of the millennium, what’s 
        understood by ‘mystic’ is a cerebralism of philologists; by love, the 
        carnal contact people unknown to each other have through a piece of rubber. 
        The three supreme values, at this point, are not only independent, but 
        antagonistic. Beauty isn’t just disconnected from goodness: it is definitely 
        bad. Goodness in its turn seems to be hypocritical, fakely sentimental 
        and stupid. Truth is ugly, meaningless and depressing. Aesthetics celebrate 
        vampires, the death of the soul, cruelty, the man who shoves his arm up 
        to the elbow inside another man’s anus. Ethics is reduced to an accusatory 
        discourse of each one against their own dislikings, sided by the most 
        cynical self-indulgence. Truth is nothing but the statistic consensus 
        of academe corrupted to their hearts.</p>
      <p align="left">Under these conditions, it is truly a miracle that an individual 
        can escape for instants from the led dome of <i>apeirokalia</i>, and another 
        miracle that, upon his return to the nightmare he calls &quot;real life&quot;, 
        these instants do not seem to him like a dream that he should better not 
        mention in public.</p>
      <p align="left">But nothing will prevent a writer from speaking, in his 
        own works, to the survivors of the spiritual doom of the twentieth century, 
        hoping that they exist and that they are not so few. Overwhelmed by the 
        combined harassment of banality and brutality, they can still suspect 
        that in their hidden dreams and hopes there is a truth more certain than 
        everything the world today imposes upon us with the label of ‘reality’, 
        guaranteed by Science and the <i>Food and Drug Administration</i>. It 
        is for those that I speak, aware that they will not be found in larger 
        numbers among the educated than among the poor and the forsaken.</p>
