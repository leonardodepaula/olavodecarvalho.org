      <p>Descartes assures us that the sequence in the <i>Meditations</i> which 
        takes him from the questioning of the outer world to the discovery of 
        the <i>Cogito</i> axiom isn't just a logical model, a hypothetical articulation 
        of thinkable thoughts, but rather an actual experience, a narrative of 
        thoughts which were thought. But, how trustworthy might have been his 
        self-observation? Can we take the faithfulness of what he reported for 
        granted? Furthermore, can we take for granted the paradigmatic universality 
        of that sequence of thoughts, admitting it will happen in equal or similar 
        fashion, with similar or equal results, to anyone who undertakes the reexamination 
        of the architecture of one's beliefs from its very foundations? Is it 
        possible for a man to have a similar experience, or, on the contrary, 
        it was Descartes who, in fact, had an entirely different experience, allowing 
        himself to be deceived and taking as a description what is purely an invention?</p>
      <p>The possibility of doubting our sensations, our imaginations and our 
        thoughts is something anyone can testify. The possibility of putting the 
        whole set of our representations on hold, reducing the &quot;world&quot; 
        to a vanishing hypothesis, is also sure.</p>
      <p>But, after performing all these operations, Descartes assures us of having 
        found, at last, the certainty of doubt: doubt is a thought, and in the 
        instant I doubt, I cannot doubt that I am thinking the doubt. The self-confidence 
        in the metaphysical solidity of the thinking ego comes forth as a powerful 
        psychological compensation for the lack of confidence in the reality of 
        the &quot;world&quot;.</p>
      <p>Even though very keen to describe the thoughts which precede the state 
        of doubt, Descartes is oddly evasive when it comes to the state of doubt 
        itself. Actually, he doesn't describe it: he only affirms it, and, jumping 
        immediately from description to deduction, he begins to draw the logical 
        consequences which the verification of this state imposes on him.</p>
      <p>Let us do what Descartes did not. Let us try to stop the impulse of consequentialist 
        automatism, and keep ourselves for a moment at the description of the 
        state of doubt.</p>
      <p>In the first place, it is not a state -- a static position in which a 
        man may rest unchangeably, just as he gets sad or in contemplation, still 
        or lying down. It is rather an alternation between a &quot;no&quot; and 
        a &quot;yes&quot;, an impossibility of resting at one of the terms of 
        an alternative without the other coming to dispute the primacy. For either 
        &quot;no&quot;, or &quot;yes&quot;, once accepted as definitive terms, 
        would immediately eliminate doubt, which consists of antagonistic coexistence 
        and of nothing else. But this antagonism isn't static: it is mobile. The 
        doubtful mind goes endlessly from on term to the other, without reaching 
        a support point where to rest and &quot;be&quot;. And, since each of the 
        terms is the other's denial, the mind would not be able to rest at any 
        of them without, for an instant, denying the other: precisely at that 
        instant, <i>the mind is not in doubt</i> - it is either affirming or denying, 
        it is affirming one thing and denying the other, even though it may not 
        be able to persevere in the affirmation or in the denial without thinking 
        of a thousand reasons to abandon either. And, in the instant of affirmation 
        or denial, doubt suppresses itself as such and fights for its establishment 
        as affirmation or denial; but it fails, and it is of this failure that 
        doubt is made of. What follows is an inevitable conclusion: <i>a doubt 
        that does not doubt itself, a doubt that, suspending the alternation, 
        imposes itself as a &quot;state&quot; and thus remains, is impossible</i>. 
        In taking doubt as a &quot;state&quot;, omitting that it is an alternation 
        between two antagonistic instants, Descartes reifies it and takes it as 
        a certainty: &quot;I cannot doubt that I doubt in the instant I doubt&quot;, 
        a sentence Descartes takes as an expression of the most conspicuous obviousness, 
        is actually the expression of logical nonsense and of psychological impossibility. 
        What would be more correct to say is that, in doubting, I doubt about 
        everything, doubt itself included. Doubt is not a state: it is the succession 
        and coexistence of antagonistic states, it is a not being able to be.<a name="2" href="#Nota 2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
      <p>What leads Descartes into error is the fact that he takes doubt for denial, 
        or, better yet, for hypothetical denial. I can, actually, make up a hypothetical 
        denial and repeat it indefinitely. I can even amplify it - hypothetically, 
        of course - to a point where it embraces what I consider to be the whole 
        extension of my knowledge. But I cannot &quot;doubt&quot; about my own 
        knowledge without, at the same time, restating it, in the sense that this 
        is the only way through which one is able to alternate its affirmations 
        and denials in the vicious circle of doubt.</p>
      <p>Set forth in these terms, the <i>cogito</i> axiom is no more than a new 
        and more obscure enunciation of the old argument of Socrates against the 
        skeptical: it is impossible to deny without affirming the denial, thus 
        without affirming something. But, from this point of view, the Cartesian 
        discovery is reduced to very little: far from having given a new foundation, 
        critical or negative, to the world of knowledge, he makes nothing but 
        demonstrating again, through the crooked path of a false psychological 
        self-description, the logical primacy of affirmation over denial. However, 
        the acknowledgement of this primacy is, simultaneously, the denial of 
        doubt as a founding act. The discovery of Descartes is a non-discovery, 
        it is the discovery of the impossibility of discovering anything through 
        a way defined, more than any other thing, by an intolerable self-contradiction.<a name="3" href="#Nota 3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
      <p>But, with that, I have solely demonstrated that doubt, as such, cannot 
        serve as a critical basis. I did not expose yet the bases which, in their 
        turn, make doubt possible. And this is the decisive point, for if there 
        is something &quot;behind&quot; doubt, it is this something, and not doubt, 
        which constitutes the firm support point Descartes looked for, and which 
        he naïvely believed to have found in the acknowledgement of doubt.</p>
      <p>Descartes says that doubt is a certainty in the instant it is thought. 
        But that is false: what is a certainty is the later reflection which affirms 
        the reality of the experience of doubt. In the very instant of doubt, 
        what happens is, as we have seen, an alternation between affirmation and 
        denial, and hence the impossibility of affirming any state, if by state 
        we understand, as one should, the coincidence of a factual judgement and 
        the feeling which grants its negative or positive value, as in sadness, 
        hurry, anger, hope etc. Doubt is not a state, for the simple reason that 
        in it the feeling, which can be of anxiety, of hope, of curiosity, etc., 
        does not coincide with a specific judgement, but emerges precisely from 
        the impossibility of affirming or denying a judgement. It is rather a 
        moment of suspension between states, an agitated void that contains the 
        germs of various possible states - at least two - and never settles upon 
        any of them without its own suppression. Therefore man never &quot;is&quot; 
        in doubt: he simply passes by it, precisely as a transition between states. 
        It is only when doubt is no longer a present experience and becomes the 
        object of reflection that arises this certainty, purely retrospective 
        and narrative: &quot;<i>I could not, up to this moment, establish myself 
        in affirmation or denial.</i>&quot; Thus, there is not only a logical 
        distinction but an actual separation between doubt as a present experience 
        and doubt as an object o recollection and reflection - and it is the latter 
        that is certain and indubitable<a name="4" href="#Nota 4"><sup>4</sup></a>, 
        not the first, even though Descartes takes one for the other and forwards 
        to us as a direct intuitive evidence what is actually the object of later 
        reflection. It is only this reflection that, in giving it a name, can 
        endow with the oneness of a &quot;state&quot; that which is actually a 
        succession of states which mutually suppress each other, or the coexistence 
        of purely potential states, each of them being able to actualise itself 
        only at the cost of the others' exclusion. Endowing the void of alternation 
        with the positive consistence of a &quot;state&quot;, Descartes at the 
        same time transforms doubt into mere hypothetical denial, taking then 
        as an actual psychological state what is rather simply the logical concept 
        of a possible state.</p>
      <p>To make things even worse, in the reflective affirmation of the reality 
        of doubt are contained, as premises, two beliefs: one in the continuity 
        of conscience between doubt and reflection, and other in the knowledge 
        of the distinction between truth and falsehood. </p>
      <p>1<sup>o</sup> Anyone who reflects about doubt is aware of still being 
        &quot;the same&quot; who had the doubt; and if the act of doubting is 
        formally distinct from the act of reflection, the conscious ego, in reflecting, 
        knows he is the subject of two distinct acts - logically distinct and 
        temporally distinct -, taking us to the conclusion that this ego is logically 
        and temporally anterior to both acts and independent from them: it is 
        not the act of doubting that founds the certainty about the ego, but, 
        on the contrary, <i>the certainty about the continuity of the ego is the 
        sole guarantee that doubt was really experienced.</i> For doubt, if it 
        did not receive from later reflection the name that endows it with the 
        apparent oneness of a state, would end up reducing itself to the mere 
        succession of non-related affirmations and denials, successive hallucinations 
        of schizophrenically plural subject, deprived of the empire of himself 
        and dissolved in the atomistic flow of his states. In order to become 
        the object of reflection, doubt is endowed with the artificial oneness 
        of a name; and if just after that the mind forgets that this mind is a 
        mere <i>ens rationis </i>and takes it for a substantial unity, then we 
        are faced with a case of reflexive self-hypnosis in which a name produces 
        magically, <i>a posteriori</i>, the reality of its object.</p>
      <p>2<sup>o</sup> Being formally distinct, the two acts are empirically distinct 
        as well, that is, distinct in time: <i>first </i>I doubt (that is, I come 
        and go between successive affirmations and denials), <i>then</i> I reflect 
        that I doubted (that is, I unify under the name &quot;doubt&quot; this 
        multitude of antagonistic experiences). But the oneness of the ego, implied 
        on this very reflection, and hence in the certainty of the doubt, is that 
        continuity in time denominated <i>memory</i> and <i>recollection</i>: 
        memory, a premise for reflection, is logically and temporally anterior 
        to reflection. Far from being able to base our confidence on memory, it 
        is doubt who depends on it to have a logical foundation and to become 
        possible in the realm of psychological facts.</p>
      <p>But, if doubt depends on the guarantee it receives from the ego and from 
        memory, then it has no founding capability. It is a founded thing, a secondary 
        and derived certainty, it is the work of a more profound and unquestionable 
        agent.</p>
      <p>3<sup>o</sup> However, doubt implies something else. How is it possible 
        to doubt? The possibility of doubt rests entirely over our ability to 
        conceive things in a way different from the way they present themselves 
        in a given moment. Doubt rests over supposition; it requires and implies 
        the ability to suppose. Once things have presented themselves to the subject 
        in one certain way, and not another, this second and supposed way can 
        present itself to conscience only as a work of the subject himself, as 
        an offspring of imagination or as a conjecture. In order to know he's 
        doubting, it is necessary for the subject to <i>know that he supposed 
        something</i> and to thus acknowledge himself as the subject of not only 
        <i>two</i> acts, as we have just seen, but of <i>three</i>: the act of 
        <i>doubting</i>, the act of <i>reflecting</i> about doubt and, before 
        both acts, the act of <i>supposing</i> or imagining. Imagination is, in 
        addition to the continuity of the ego and to memory, the third requirement 
        and the third basis for the possibility of doubt.</p>
      <p>4<sup>o</sup> But, should the subject never notice any difference between 
        things as they present themselves to him and things the way he imagines 
        them, the subject would never be able to know that he supposed, since 
        there would be no distinction between to suppose and to perceive. Therefore, 
        the awareness of this difference is also a requirement and a basis for 
        the possibility of doubt. To doubt, I need to distinguish, in my representation, 
        what's given and what's construed, what's received and what's invented, 
        that which I get already finished and that which I do and propose. Consequently, 
        here is the assumption of the difference between the objective and the 
        subjective, and, thus, the belief in the objectivity of the objective 
        and in the subjectivity of the subjective.</p>
      <p>5<sup>o</sup> Yet, should the subject confuse these two domains, believing 
        that he supposed what was perceived and that he perceived what he supposed, 
        he would have lost the continuity of conscience and of memory, which is, 
        as we have seen, a condition for the possibility of doubt. Therefore, 
        the doubt about the reality of the world cannot present itself as a mere 
        choice between two possibilities of equal value sprang from the same origin, 
        but <i>always as a choice between something given and something supposed, 
        between the perceived and the invented.</i></p>
      <p>6<sup>o</sup> It is not possible to doubt about the reality of the world 
        without knowing first that this doubt, and the supposition which serves 
        as its basis, are but pure inventions of the subject himself, and this 
        invention is formally and temporally distinct from the act of perceiving 
        and from the perceived content. Doubt is a supposition that an invented 
        world is more valid than the received world, a supposition based, in its 
        turn, in the conscience to invent, to suppose and to pretend. The doubt 
        about the reality of the world is always and necessarily an act of pretending, 
        and the more the pretender works to take this doubt seriously, to make 
        it more and more verisimilar, the more the glow of the <i>performance</i> 
        will attest to the difference between the verisimilar and the true, as 
        in a play, we applaud the actor exactly because we know that he is <i>not</i> 
        the character.</p>
      <p>7<sup>o</sup> But this conscience of pretending would be impossible if 
        it were not founded, in its turn, on the conscience of the difference 
        between to think and to be, to imagine and to act. For, once it is implied 
        the conscience of the difference between to supposing and perceiving, 
        parallel to the conscience the ego has of its own actions, there wouldn't 
        be a way to deny that the thinking ego is conscious of the difference 
        between the supposed action and the effective action, once the effective 
        action is not just thought, but physically perceived, exactly like the 
        beings from the physical world. I cannot, therefore, doubt about the beings 
        of the physical world without, in the same act, doubt about the physical 
        acts I see myself performing, like the movements of my hands and legs. 
        But, at the same time, I cannot doubt about them without questioning, 
        in the same instant, the continuity and the oneness of the ego, which 
        is, in spite of it, a premise for the act of doubting about just any thing. 
        Here is another reason for which doubt, being dubious in its own nature, 
        would not be able to establish itself if not by doubting about itself, 
        that is, being aware that it is founded on a supposition and on deliberate 
        pretending. Here is also why doubt is something so rare and demanding: 
        it implies a movements that contradicts itself, that questions the very 
        conditions which make it possible.<a name="5" href="#Nota 5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
      <p>8<sup>o</sup> Finally, doubt is only possible when it is known that something, 
        either in what is perceived or in what is supposed, is not adequate, when 
        it does not meet a fundamental requirement of truthfulness. But how could 
        the doubting subject demand truthfulness of his suppositions if he did 
        not have any idea about truthfulness? This demand would be inconceivable 
        without an idea of truth, even as a mere imaginary object of desire. The 
        desire for bases presumes in the subject at least the possibility of imagining 
        that his knowledge can be even more reliable than he actually feels at 
        a given moment, that is, truth as an ideal and the option for truth. But, 
        at the same time, we saw that the subject did not know this truth just 
        as an abstract ideal, but that he already was aware of <i>at least one</i> 
        actual difference between truth and falsehood: the difference between 
        what is given and what is supposed, followed by the true awareness that 
        what was received was not supposed and what was supposed was not received.</p>
      <p>Thus, doubt erects itself upon a whole building of perceptions and presumptions: 
        far from being first logically, it is a very elaborate and sophisticated 
        product of a knowledge machine. Far from having a founding power, it is 
        no more than a more or less accidental and secondary manifestation of 
        a system of certainties.</p>
      <p>However, if things are as such, if the primacy of methodical doubt is 
        only the primacy of a mistake, then are under suspicion, similarly, the 
        Kantian primacy of the critique problem, the positivist dogma of the impossibility 
        to have a valid metaphysical certainty, and many other belief which today's 
        man takes, in spite of his own will, as obvious and blatant truths. But 
        this is a subject for future addresses, which will be presented in other 
        opportunities. Thank you.</p>
