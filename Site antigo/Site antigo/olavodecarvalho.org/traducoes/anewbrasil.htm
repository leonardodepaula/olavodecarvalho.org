      <br>
      <p><b>The regime in this country changed and no one was warned of it </b></p>
      <p>People who know things only through hearsay swear that communism is dead. 
        But Mr. Antonio Negri and I, who studied the subject for decades and certainly 
        cannot be accused of rehearsing our lines backstage, assure you that it 
        is more alive than ever. Also, Mr. Fidel Castro, who is informed of all 
        the subterraneous preparations, announces that soon we will have the spectacular 
        <i>rentrée</i> of the bloody pantomime to which he dedicated his filthy 
        life. </p>
      <p>Two recent facts give reason to me and these illustrious gentlemen. </p>
      <p>1. A judge in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, when asked to give back 
        to its proprietors a farm invaded by MST, denied the right of reintegration 
        of possession under the allegation that there was no proof of the “social 
        function” of the property. </p>
      <p>2. A notorious terrorist of the seventies, who never repented of his 
        crimes, is rather proud of them and that, at best, admitted having some 
        doubts on the convenience of repeating them today, was named Minister 
        of Justice. </p>
      <p>As to the first fact, five details give evidence of the spirit with which 
        this was done. (1) The lack of “social function” did not have to be proven: 
        the lack of evidence was enough as evidence of the lack. (2) This “proof” 
        served to legitimize not a legal confiscation, done by the State, but 
        rather the occupation of the property by a third party. (3) The judge 
        recognized his decision was political. (4) The new owners were not required 
        to prove, on their turn, the social usefulness of their property or of 
        any other property taken by the MST, regarding which judges do not make 
        any demands for production; to be recognized as legitimate property, it 
        is enough that they be used for guerrilla training. (5) The sentence was 
        maintained by the State Court of Justice and received quite a lot of praise 
        from Mr. Dalmo Dallari, but no one would expect anything less from him. 
      </p>
      <p>As to the second fact, it occurred (1) in a country where the simple 
        accusation of having tortured a communist is enough to exonerate from 
        his functions on the spot, and without any need of evidence, any public 
        servant of high, low or middle echelon; (2) at a moment when the international 
        consensus proclaims the need to persecute and punish all the terrorists 
        and their protectors. </p>
      <p>The sense of the first event is clear: the right of property acquired 
        by legal means depends on the proof of its   “social function”, but the 
        right to property taken by force depends only of the political colors 
        of the new proprietors. With no reimbursement, with no indemnification, 
        any property can be immediately transferred to the first party that takes 
        possession of it, on the only condition that he does so under a pretext 
        politically agreeable to Their Excellencies  – Dallaris <i>e tutti quanti</i>. 
      </p>
      <p>A principle like that will be used for all real estate – rural or urban, 
        residential, commercial or industrial –, except those that have propaganda 
        value or strategic usefulness for the communist cause, the only social 
        function that is demanded from a property of the MST. </p>
      <p>The second event is also clear: (1) the crime of torture, even if not 
        proven, and being imputed only to anticommunists, is an impediment to 
        the exercise of the public function; but the terrorism practiced by communists, 
        even when it is confessed, is not; (2) as it adopts this scale of values, 
        Brazil aligns itself officially, barefacedly, with the countries that 
        protect and legitimize the practice of terrorism. Nothing can attenuate 
        or hide the sense of this option. </p>
      <p>Whoever knows the history of the communist revolutions will recognize 
        that, since last week, Brazil is no longer a capitalist democracy. It 
        is a country in open transition to communism, where the declaration of 
        one’s ideology is worth as a document of possession of real estate, and 
        crimes of terrorism committed with the proper ideological motivation are 
        curricular laurels for the exercise of a ministerial function. Few communist 
        revolutions started in such an effective, direct way, without finding 
        the least resistance. But how do you explain this to people that – not 
        knowing anything about communism – believe themselves authorized to proclaim 
        that it does not exist?</p>
