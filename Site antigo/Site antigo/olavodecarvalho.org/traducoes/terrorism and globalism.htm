      <p><br>
        <p>For more than a decade leftist intellectuals placed in Escola Superior 
        de Guerra and in military academies have tried to sell to officers of 
        our armed forces the theory that, with the fall of USSR and the end of 
        Communism, the world became unipolar and the only pole, with its growing 
        ambition of world dominance, is the virtual enemy against which strategic 
        plans of national defense should be turned.</p>
        <p>Cowed by insistent campaigns of journalistic slander that accuse them 
        of the worst crimes, and by the creation of a Ministry of the Defense 
        that excludes them from ministerial meetings, and by budgets cuts that 
        reduce the armed forces to impotence, and by the proliferation of NGOs 
        for Indians and environmental causes that exclude military vigilance over 
        growing portions of Amazon territory etc. etc., many officers tend to 
        accept that theory, which allows them to see, behind so many humiliations 
        they suffer, the figure of one villain: American imperialism.</p>
        
      <p>From such assumptions, the reaction of the Bush administration to the 
        September 11 attacks would be another step in the escalation of American 
        imperialism that puts the world in danger and, naturally, Brazil. To give 
        more credibility to that &quot;conspiracy theory&quot;, the latest editorial 
        of &quot;<i>Ombro a Ombro</i>&quot;, the newspaper of the military distributed 
        among thousands of Brazilian officers, even rehashes the old jargon of 
        the anti-American campaigns at the time of the Vietnam war, dividing those 
        at the top in Washington between &quot;doves&quot;, that want to submit 
        American belligerence to the control of the UN, and the &quot;hawks&quot;, 
        that don't accept any limitation, and want to rule the world. The conclusion 
        drawn from it is obvious: that national defense should enter into alliance 
        with &quot;doves&quot;, giving support to multinational forces which, 
        from Cuba to China and to the European Economic Community and Mr. Yasser 
        Arafat, want to cut the wings of the &quot;hawks&quot;. The conclusion 
        is so coherent with the assumptions that it is almost imposes itself automatically. 
        There is only one problem: the assumptions are false.</p>
        <p>(1) There is no unipolar world . There is, on one side, the US-Israel 
        alliance and, on the other, the block of the leftist globalism, entrenched 
        in the UN. In a military sense, the bastions of the last are China--involved 
        in growing nuclear preparation on the scale of global war--, Russia (that, 
        under the cover, never ceased helping terrorists in the whole world), 
        some Arab countries strongly armed and, last but not least, the worldwide 
        net of narco-terrorist organizations; economically, the European Economic 
        Community, without whose support Arafat's thrusts against Israel would 
        have already ceased for lack of fuel; and in the political and publicity 
        fields, the grand international leftist media (including the main American 
        newspapers), that crucifies George W. Bush daily.</p>
        <p>(2) The US are not a reverse Soviet Union, a totalitarian right wing state 
        apt to formulate long term strategic plans that continue to be followed 
        faithfully through generations, but a democracy, whose foreign policy 
        changes water to wine at each new presidential election.</p>
        <p>(3) All the imperialistic pressures that would have been behind the humiliation 
        of our armed forces came during the government of the most innocent of 
        the &quot;doves&quot;, Mr. Bill Clinton, and not the &quot;hawk&quot; 
        George W. Bush.</p>
        <p>(4) Mr. Clinton, at the same time he was exercising those pressures on 
        us and on many other countries, cut the strength, the budget, the fleet 
        and the nuclear resources of the armed forces of his own country, blocked 
        investigation about the infiltration of Arab terrorists, seriously weakened 
        the CIA and FBI and, in short, did exactly the reverse of what it would 
        be logical in an imperialistic escalation. Also: elected with the help 
        of Chinese campaign funds, he also vetoed investigations against Chinese 
        nuclear espionage in Los Alamos and did the devil to transfer the control 
        of the Panama Canal, to China, a strategic zone. Finally, after September 
        11, he stuck to the rhetoric of the international left that threw, on 
        the victim, blame for the attacks and demanded that the US, instead of 
        exercising its right of defense, consented in becoming a mere auxiliary 
        force of UN. What the hell of Yankee imperialist is he? Viewed, therefore, 
        as signs of Washington's imperial ambition, the anti-Brazilian pressures 
        of the Clinton administration make no sense at all. Viewed as maneuvers 
        to play Brazil against the US and to strengthen the other pole of global 
        dominance, they make all the sense in the world.</p>
        <p>(5) The press campaigns against our armed forces--parallel to the beatification 
        of terrorists of the 1970s --have always come from leftist journalists 
        who, in international politics, join ranks with that second pole, against 
        the US.</p>
        <p>(6) Our military were not only disarmed materially and morally. They were 
        disarmed intellectually: the suppression of studies of &quot;revolutionary 
        war&quot; from the required subjects at military academies left two generations 
        of army officers completely unprepared to act in a picture of continental 
        revolutionary violence, today more intense and vaster than in the 1970s. 
        The present President of the Republic is today the same enthusiastic follower 
        of presidential candidate who, at meetings of the Forum of S&atilde;o 
        Paulo, from 1990 to 2001, signed successive solidarity pacts with Latin-Americans 
        terrorist organizations.</p>
        <p>(7) The NGOs that infest our Amazon, withhold it from the watch of the 
        armed forces, most with no roots in the US, but in European countries 
        and the UN, that is to say: at the other imperialistic pole, of anti-American 
        globalism (which, it is clear, has the support of Mr. Clinton and remaining 
        doves in the US.</p>
      <p>Of those observations, one can only conclude that our armed forces, and 
        especially the new generations of officers, are the target of a vast and 
        persistent disinformation and manipulation effort, to turn them into docile 
        instruments of organized anti-Americanism, of the continental revolution 
        and of the leftist globalist pole. Today, the four leftist candidates 
        announce flattering promises to end two decades of humiliation, to restore 
        the dignity of our armed forces. But can there be dignity in one who let 
        himself be sold cheaply to same who did so much to knock down his price?</p>
