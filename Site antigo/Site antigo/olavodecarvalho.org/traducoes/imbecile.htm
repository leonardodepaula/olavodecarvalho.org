      <p>The success of Richard Rorty in Brazil might seem strange, as local intellectuality 
        is mainly of Marxist extraction and would have every reason to reject 
        pragmatism as a capitalistic ideology. But the stage was already set for 
        the arrival of Rorty in Brazil by three decades of Gramscian hegemony. 
        Gramsci, the most influential Marxist theorist in Brazil, was not a pure-breed 
        Marxist, but a mixture of Marxist and pragmatist, of the lineage of his 
        master Antonio Labriola. Labriola not only agrees with pragmatism in general 
        terms, but in particular, in a significant coincidence, his Philosophy 
        of History is identical to Richard Rorty’s in a point where both are in 
        evident disagreement with Karl Marx: they both deny that History has a 
        &quot;meaning&quot;. This denial is obviously inconsistent with the ideology 
        of &quot;progress&quot; which is intrinsic to Marxism.</p>
      <p>The sudden interest shown by progressive intellectuals in philosophies 
        that deny the meaning of History clearly stems from the depressive feeling 
        that followed the failure of international communism. Not capable of restraining 
        themselves to the optimistic vision of communism, they sought refuge in 
        an ideology close at hand, one capable of explaining the apparently absurd 
        course of History without forcing them to a rupture with the atheistic 
        and materialistic basis of Marxism. With this aim, some strove to ransack 
        and recover old materialistic theories that Marxism itself believed to 
        have absorbed and overcome. Others sought to reconcile themselves with 
        &quot;bourgeois&quot; materialistic currents, like the analytical philosophy 
        of Russel and Wittgenstein (who were widely read in Brazil during the 
        1980’s), and, naturally, with pragmatism. First there was the fashion 
        of Charles Sanders Peirce, a fifth-class philosopher, who was venerated 
        as an icon in some Brazilian university circles. But the best actually 
        came with Rorty, whose similarities with Gramsci make him irresistible 
        to the eyes of local intellectuals.</p>
      <p>The most significant of these similarities is the denial of objective 
        knowledge and the consequent reduction of intellectual activity to propaganda 
        and conscience manipulation. Both Gramsci and Rorty deny that human knowledge 
        may describe the real, and both declare that the only objective of our 
        cultural and scientific efforts is to express collective desires. Also, 
        for both of them, there are no universal concepts, nor universally valid 
        judgements. But we can &quot;create&quot; universals through propaganda, 
        making all people share in the same beliefs or, better said, in the same 
        illusions. The function of intellectuality is therefore to create those 
        illusions and, as Rorty says, &quot;gradually inculcate them&quot; in 
        the mind of the people. They disagree only on the identity of the intellectual: 
        for Rorty, he is the academic community, while for Gramsci it is the Party 
        or the &quot;collective intellectual&quot;.</p>
      <p>These two ghostly entities, whose task is to direct the consciences of 
        beings without a conscience, are formed by individuals who, by themselves, 
        do not have any conscience at all. They also share the utmost disregard 
        for arguments and proofs and display an exaggerated taste for the psychological 
        action that shapes the feelings of the mass without allowing for any discussion 
        and without being accountable to the requirements of &quot;truth&quot;. 
        In both of them, the shrewdness in manipulating the real substitutes the 
        intelligence of knowing it. <i>Manipulating the real?</i> No. Manipulating 
        its image in the mind of the public.</p>
      <p>As much as the academic community of Peirce and Rorty, the &quot;collective 
        intellectual&quot; of Gramsci lacks the real unity of an organism, possessing 
        only the functional and more or less conventional unity of a club or an 
        army. For this very reason, it cannot be intelligent, nor can it have 
        intuitive perceptions. What it is to understand? It is to capture, in 
        an instant, the objective unity of a set of data, arranging them in a 
        framework that is immediately made available to all psychic faculties: 
        to will, to feeling, to imagination, etc. It is this simultaneous availability 
        of information that enables the individual to react as a whole to distinct 
        situations, without the mediation of a long and complex decisional process. 
        It is the &quot;presence of mind&quot;, the alert conscience that enables 
        a full and efficient adaptation to changes, without the loss of biographic 
        continuity or of the meaning of life. How could a collective entity rise 
        to this level of conscience? In order to understand and to decide at the 
        speed that an individual does, the collective entity must place an individual 
        above all others and follow his decisions without discussion. But in order 
        to preserve internal democracy, it must submit the decisions to the approval 
        of all members and wait for the outcome of the discussions, during which 
        time thousands of deviating factors will interfere, such as the mingling 
        of other issues, the competition among vanities in the assemblies, etc. 
        Ultimately, the final decision will be a mechanic arrangement of pressures 
        and concessions and not the immediate answer of a conscience to a perception 
        of reality. The &quot;collective intellectual&quot; must choose between 
        the unity of a tyranny and the multiplication of languages; between explicit 
        or implicit submission to any individual conscience and the dissolution 
        in a collective unconsciousness that, at last, will end up being discretely 
        manipulated by some smart individual. In short, it must choose between 
        declared and dissimulated tyranny.</p>
      <p>During the time when the principle of the &quot;collective intellectual&quot; 
        was in force only within the Communist Party, its cult of unconsciousness 
        affected only those directly engaged in leftist movements, preventing 
        them from seeing the most obvious and blatant facts, like the Trials of 
        Moscow, the economic failure of the USSR, the Gulag, etc.</p>
      <p>But with the fall of communist hierarchy, the spirit of the &quot;collective 
        intellectual&quot; leaked from the moribund body of communism to intellectuals 
        in general. Nowadays, particularly in Brazil, intellectual life as a whole 
        imitates, by the uniformity of its issues and values, the internal discussions 
        of the old Communist Party, the collective processing of ideas by a mass 
        of militants to obtain, through the sum of votes, the infallible definition 
        of the &quot;Party line&quot;. This way, individual intelligence loses 
        all capacity to operate alone, not being able, by itself, to understand 
        anything anymore. Thus confirming what the widespread buzzing boasts about 
        the inanity of autonomous conscience, individual intelligence only shows 
        itself capable of acting in an atmosphere of unanimous agreement, of &quot;participation&quot; 
        in the collective feeling. As everyone is immersed in this collective 
        feeling, nobody can look at it from the outside, as fish do not see water. 
        Intellectual life is thereby reduced to the mutual inter-confirmation 
        of beliefs, prejudices, feelings and habits of the members of the literate 
        group. It becomes a tribalism.</p>
      <p>One would err by excessive optimism to perceive this involution as a 
        passing phenomenon that only scratches the surface of History. It has 
        an anthropological dimension, it affects the fate of the human species 
        in the cosmos. It only takes a generation of &quot;collective intellectuals&quot; 
        dominating the world for us to lose the individualization of conscience, 
        the prize of a millenarian evolutionary effort.</p>
      <p>The idea of the &quot;collective intellectual&quot; has one of the most 
        compromising origins. It was born in the clubs, assemblies and literary 
        salons where the French Revolution was generated, in the &quot;Republic 
        of Letters&quot;. It was there that for the first time modern intellectuality 
        felt the strength of its union and was sacred queen under the title of 
        &quot;public opinion&quot;. As a matter of fact, this term did not designate 
        the opinion of the masses, but the common feeling of the literate elite 
        . What was characteristic of those clubs and differentiated them from 
        scientific societies as we know them today, and also from the centers 
        of debate in Medieval university, was the total absence of rational criteria 
        for the validation of arguments. It was the empire of &quot;opinion&quot;, 
        in the sense of the Greek <i>doxa</i>, or mere belief. In those clubs, 
        the theoretical questions of Gnoseology, Metaphysics, Economics, or even 
        those of the natural sciences were decided by force, according to the 
        preferences of the majority group. The true doctrine was not one which 
        coincided with reality, but rather one which better expressed the collective 
        aspirations in a language flattering to the passions of the moment. Once 
        the winds of Revolution abated, the scientific and academic institutions 
        of the winning bourgeoisie endeavored to organize themselves obviously 
        not according to the example of revolutionary societies, but according 
        to the consecrated canons of Medieval university and of the scientific 
        circles of Renaissance. The &quot;Republic of Letters&quot;, as everybody 
        knew, served only to agitate the masses, but could not generate knowledge. 
        It does not seem strange, therefore, that the model of society of the 
        revolutionary debates would next be seized by those excluded by the new 
        order: the socialist intellectuals.</p>
      <p>But it would not remain confined to them for ever. If during the XX century 
        an atmosphere of Jacobinic club slowly and surreptitiously takes over 
        the totality of cultural life, this is due, to a great extent, to the 
        proletarianization of universities which – once centers for the generation 
        of a scientific and governing elite – converted themselves in centers 
        for the professional education of the masses (while transferring the task 
        of forming the elite to more discreet, if not secret institutions).</p>
      <p>The democratization of education opened to millions of people the access 
        to intellectual and scientific professions. What was an elite, a bunch 
        of geniuses who exchanged ideas through private mail and through half 
        a dozen academic publications, became an innumerable multitude. This quantitative 
        expansion, accompanied by a lowering of requirements, resulted in a formidable 
        downgrading. The intellectual proletariat, scattered in thousands of institutions 
        and busy with its daily professional tasks, does not even strive to keep 
        up with the march of ideas in the world. Each professional has resigned 
        himself to not being able to follow the succession of discoveries in his 
        own area of expertise. Each one follows his own tunnel, without knowing 
        where the others lead. To make up for the unbalance caused by specialization, 
        a prosthesis called &quot;general culture&quot; is then applied to the 
        expert, and soon universities have to flood the market with a regiment 
        of &quot;experts in general culture&quot;. Mainly comprised of those who 
        were not able to specialize in anything else, this new profession endeavors 
        alternately to trim the cake of professional knowledge with a cherry of 
        culture, leisurely disconnected from all reference to practical life, 
        and to sketch a synthesis between culture and praxis through ideological 
        indoctrination.</p>
      <p>Thereby, the very nature of university professions came to be perverted: 
        the university professional does not have to be able to form a personal 
        reasonable opinion anymore. He is a worker, an employee who follows the 
        collective fashion, as formerly did middle class employees and manual 
        workers. Thus, as the amount of scientific information increases, the 
        capacity, the necessity, and the simple willingness to absorb it diminishes.</p>
      <p>Then, with the advent of the services economy, whose dominant industry 
        is that of &quot;cultural goods&quot;, the intellectual proletariat expanded 
        to encompass the majority of the population of rich countries and almost 
        the whole middle class of poor countries. As a result, superior cultural 
        production had to meet a massive demand for cheap thrills, now honored 
        by &quot;intellectual&quot; prestige. The gossip of old show-business 
        magazines, for example, invaded historical research, acquiring the status 
        of a respectable academic activity. Moved by the necessity of flattering 
        the most vulgar passions, superior culture ends up modeling itself by 
        sheer marketing criteria, with which the collective imbecile confirms, 
        circularly, that there is no truth above the taste of the majority.</p>
      <p>In this atmosphere, rational discussion becomes impossible. Consensus 
        is formed by waves of feelings that confusedly agitate themselves in the 
        air, producing brief epidermic shivers. Beliefs are molded and dissolved 
        in an impressionistic atmosphere, as moving ink-spots in a wet paper. 
        It is the time of Rhetoric, of psychological persuasion, of a vague and 
        disguised blackmailing which replaces argumentation. And finally, the 
        actual state of things claims to be elevated to the status of rule and 
        law: the B&ouml;hms, Feyerabends, Kuhns, Rortys, come to the scene, advocating 
        the legitimacy of the rhetorical argument, of the emotive appeal, and 
        even of the subliminal influence as a means of scientific proof. The notion 
        of &quot;truthfulness&quot; – which the first generation of proletarian 
        intellectuals had already reduced to a conventional formalism, voiding 
        it of its ontological substance – goes up in smoke and is at last ostensibly 
        denied. Ideas win followers by affective contagion, and once they become 
        dominant they do not even need to display a pretension for truthfulness. 
        They possess a better argument: the force of numbers that spreads the 
        fear of isolation (vaguely identified with misery and madness) in the 
        souls of the recalcitrant ones. Underneath the festive adherence to the 
        new intellectual fashions, the persuasive machinery of psychological terror 
        gloomily creaks on.</p>
      <p>These are, in summary, the dominant tendencies in the scientific and 
        philosophical debate of today’s world. In older countries, which preserve 
        the values inherited from the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, these tendencies 
        may at times be compensated by some critical and organizing reaction. 
        But the new countries, which entered into History after the French Revolution 
        and absorbed little from the legacy of the preceding centuries, do not 
        have the least defense against the spirit of the &quot;collective intellectual&quot;, 
        which in these countries tends to be identified, by an unconscious dogmatism, 
        with the only possible incarnation of the idea of superior culture. There, 
        to become an &quot;intellectual&quot; is not to acquire a certain knowledge 
        and to demonstrate capacity in a certain class of investigation or creation. 
        It is rather to be accepted in some circles, to speak in a specific tone, 
        to adopt some ways of behavior in which the identity of the caste may 
        be recognized. For this reason, a great philosopher who lives a secluded 
        life ends up being excluded from the cultural history of the country, 
        as occurred with M&aacute;rio Ferreira dos Santos, while the worldly man, 
        popular in certain groups, will become a renowned intellectual even if 
        he doesn’t leave a work worth reading and even if he discovers nothing 
        worth knowing.</p>
      <p>Brazil is the promised land of the &quot;collective intellectual&quot;.</p>
