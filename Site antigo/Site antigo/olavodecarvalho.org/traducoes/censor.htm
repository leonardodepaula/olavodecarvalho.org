      <p><b>Now it is scientific and meticulous</b></p>
      <p>Comparing the censorship from the time of the military government with 
        the Gramscian system of information control that the left has installed 
        in Brazil today is like comparing the management of a neighborhood deli 
        with the scientific administration of a multinational company. </p>
      <p>The military censorship, from the beginning, presented itself ostensibly 
        as such and did not make any effort to hide its presence. Everyone knew 
        that verses from Camoens’ <i>Os Lusíadas</i> and cake recipes meant suppressed 
        news. If a newspaper, not to jeopardize itself commercially, covered up 
        the gaps with innocuous news, it did that because it wanted to. No one 
        forced that. The censorship recognized itself as an abnormal and provisory 
        phenomenon, with no long-term ambition to manipulate the conscience of 
        the people. </p>
      <p>Second, its reach, at least in the beginning, was more of a police-military 
        nature than political. There was at the time the urban guerrilla, with 
        kidnappings and robberies happening all over the place, and the order 
        was to keep the media from becoming propaganda instrument of the guerrillas. 
        Today we know that they were few and poorly armed, but at the time this 
        was not the impression that they themselves disseminated: if they tried 
        to terrify the government to induce it to feel cornered by a civil war, 
        they did it being perfectly aware that the reaction of any government 
        in theses circumstances would be to implement a state of exception, that 
        would include the control of information. Their reasoning, as usual in 
        the communist strategy, was two-edged: if the government did not react, 
        it would risk being beaten militarily; if it did react, it could be afterwards 
        demoralized by decades of cries against censorship. The immense tear-historiographic 
        production of left-wing academics that even today impose to national conscience 
        a falsified vision of that time was already planned since then: it is 
        the political recycling of the military defeat, the continuation of guerrilla 
        through other means. </p>
      <p>It is true that later the cuts became bigger, suppressing political news 
        with no relation to the guerrilla. But, by their own random and aimless 
        characteristics, many of these cuts were the exact opposite of a planned 
        operation: they were the general madness disseminated among inapt and 
        terrified civil servants that, without precise instructions, desperately 
        wanted to show effectiveness. Thirdly, the censorship acted exclusively 
        over the popular media, without interfering in the circulation of books 
        (only a few were forbidden, because they taught the techniques of urban 
        guerrilla) and in academic publications. That is why the time presented 
        today as having the most rigid state control of thought was the time of 
        the greatest blooming of left-wing editorial in all of our History – many 
        times with the financial help of the government itself – and the time 
        of the consolidation of left-wing hegemony in the academic and cultural 
        environment. </p>
      <p>Limited objectives, renouncing to long-term influence, awkward execution 
        through uncouth civil servants, almost total abstention from deep interference 
        in the superior sphere of the ideas and culture. Such are the marks that 
        characterized military censorship, to which would be a demagogic exaggeration 
        to give the dimensions of a true manipulation of conscience. </p>
      <p>In contrast, the left-wing control of information today aims essentially 
        long term objectives, has at its service the best-trained academic professionals, 
        acts mainly from the top, through the control of ideas and of historical 
        visions that are susceptible of shaping the future, and, above all, is 
        meticulous in its zeal of covering its tracks. The specter of facts and 
        ideas whose circulation it blocks is immensely bigger than the one covered 
        by military censorship, to the point of hiding from the Brazilian student 
        population practically all the production of the conservative thinkers 
        of the last decades and whole chapters of national History. For instance, 
        the participation of Cuba in the direction of our guerrillas, denied for 
        20 years as a perfid right-wing lie, has now been proven, under general 
        protest, by the courageous study of Denise Rollemberg, <i>Cuban Support 
        to Armed Conflict in Brazil</i> (<i>Apoio de Cuba À Luta Armada no Brasil, 
        </i>Rio, Mauad, 2001).</p>
