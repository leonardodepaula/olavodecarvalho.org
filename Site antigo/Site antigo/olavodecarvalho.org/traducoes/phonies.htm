      <p>Following the September attacks, a wave of indignation has spontaneously 
        washed over the hearts of Brazilian toward international terrorism. Since 
        then, local academic leaders have dedicated themselves, with all their 
        means and skills, to turn it against the victim. So vast is the mobilization 
        of brain power to that end that, if the same energy were used on useful 
        tasks, Brazil would break its long tradition of having won no prices in 
        scientific research and, for a change, win them all. It’s frightening 
        to see our society, always aghast at the disappearance of public money 
        into the pockets of lawmakers, happily pay taxes to keep an even more 
        useless and perverse caste in place than politicians. More useless, perverse, 
        and expensive. Brazil has more university professors to students per capita 
        than any other country: one for each eight students. One chief for eight 
        little Indians. It might be said that we’re the most educated country 
        on Earth. But, with some much honorable exceptions, each one of those 
        chiefs has his own objectives, a secret agenda unrelated to teaching, 
        culture, and civilization. Pretending to teach, each one merely attempts 
        to promote a Socialist revolution that would make him, Mr. Little Joe, 
        the Minister of State, an officer of the secret police, or at least a 
        commissary of the people. Being an intellectual in this country is to 
        conduct a Gramscian revolution, which is to put intellectuals in power. 
        Being an academic intellectual is to do so while receiving public money. 
        When one of these doctors, with an air of scientific superior impartiality, 
        force into the reader mind the version that the attacks were the work 
        of “extreme right-wing” Yankee forces, and not fanatics goaded by leftist 
        international media, what he is doing is treating you, my friend, like 
        Pavlov’s dog, a circus bear, a worthless little beast designed to dance 
        and wag its little tail for the master, without being able or willing 
        to think. He is lying and manipulating at the service of psychological 
        warfare, which in this or all similar attacks serves to support terrorists 
        and widen the political effects of their actions. He is not an analyst, 
        a student, a professor: rather a celebrated terrorist, who is assigned 
        to the misinformation section for being too cowardly, too old, or too 
        smart to risk his life in truculent enterprises.</p>
      <p>In other parts of the world, a counterfeiter would think twice before 
        trying to pass off such a blatantly phony bill. In the world, there are 
        people even in academic caste who know that extreme right militants in 
        the U.S., including doomsday prophets, white supremacists and “tutti quanti”, 
        number no more than 4,000, according to the FBI; that all of their steps 
        are monitored by the police and, in the bottom line, represent the most 
        insignificant political force on the planet; and who know that their only 
        relevance is thanks to the leftist media, which uses them as a scarecrow... 
        In the world, there are people who witnessed the fearful and boasted neo-Nazi 
        movement in Germany dissolve alongside the Communist government in East 
        Berlin that funded it… In the world, there are people who, in the face 
        of the incriminating discourse of the “extreme right,” would soon realize 
        the dubiousness of the term, used to fuse into a semantic cloud, from 
        one side, those criminals accused by the establishment and, from the other, 
        the very establishment: closet anarchists, Nazis and anti-Semites, conspiring 
        with American capitalists and Jews in order to make Jews agree to blow 
        themselves up in the pure goal of creating a wave of anti-left hatred. 
        The image is so childish that a right-minded academic agitator would hardly 
        dare to suggest it to a mature public. But in Brazil, we not only lend 
        an ear to these people, we pay them to reduce us to mental childhood.</p>
      <p>Equally powerful in making us complete imbeciles, while slightly less 
        showy, is the general appeal of Fidel Castro’s argument regarding the 
        attacks, which are evil per se, but morally justified as reactions to 
        desperation amid the suffocating omnipresence of American power.</p>
      <p>What omnipresence is that? No countries are currently under American 
        occupation, while Lhasa, Tibet, has fewer Tibetans than Chinese soldiers; 
        and in the very country that harbors Bin Laden, it was the Russians and 
        not the Americans who killed a million Afghanis, halting the massacre 
        only when American support tipped the scales toward the Muslims.</p>
      <p>And what desperation is that, which turns against the most generous of 
        benefactors? Excluding the events in Kuwait and Granada, the U.S. has 
        for decades, manipulated by the UN, agreed to take part in foreign interventions 
        only when they are intended to help Communists seize power or maintain 
        it. This was what happened, for example, in the Communist aggressions 
        in Angola and Goa. As in Katanga, where UN troops, subsidized and lauded 
        by the U.S. government, laid waste to a rebel province only to integrate 
        it into the bloody dictatorship of Patrice Lumumba, young son of KGB. 
        As in South Africa today, where the UN and the New York establishment, 
        underneath the anti-racist rhetoric, conceal the “ethnic cleansing” conducted 
        by Communists against Boer farmers. And, when this type of policy leads 
        to a massacre of colossal proportion on par with Rwanda in 1994, when 
        800,000 people were slaughtered by hordes intoxicated by equalitarian 
        ideology, not only the State Department and the UN Security Council kept 
        quiet, but the U.S. media made it possible to rebuff the ideologic sense 
        od the events, and reduce it to a “war among savages,” which was actually 
        the logical and foreseeable effect of a long revolutionary indoctrination. 
        With nearly obsessive regularity, since President Roosevelt ignored the 
        Chinese revolution with the dazzling excuse that Mao Tse-Tung was not 
        a Communist but a “Christian agrarian reformer,” and until the suicidal 
        concessions were made in light of Chinese arms build-up by a president 
        elected with Chinese campaign funds, U.S. politics cyclically and increasingly 
        revisits this perfidious and masochistic conduct: support the Communists 
        through nebulous operations which, in a culmination of cynicism or lunacy, 
        are presented to the public as anti-Communist. For the Communists, the 
        benefit is two-fold. On one hand, they receive resources: money, weapons, 
        support from international organizations. On the other, each new event 
        creates a new realistic pretext for the press to speak against the sordid 
        investments in Yankee anti-Communist spending. How could any leftist be 
        “desperate” in such a comfortable situation?</p>
