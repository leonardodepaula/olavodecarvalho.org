      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099"><i><font color="9f3000">The 
        text of this small book is composed of four classes, delivered in April 
        1987 in my course Introduction to Intellectual Life. In the oral exposition 
        I was able to add comments and developments which, even though omitted 
        from the book, can be hinted at by the footnotes.</font></i></font></p>
      <p><font color="9f3000"><i><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">Now, 
        looking from a distance of four years at this work so full of good intentions 
        as it is of faults, I noticed at least two which, if cannot be completely 
        remedied, should at least be confessed.</font></i></font></p>
      <p><font color="9f3000"><i><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">The 
        first is the use of the plural form which some call 'modest' and others 
        'majestic', a vice I have forever abandoned.</font></i></font></p>
      <p><font color="9f3000"><i><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">The 
        second is that the concept of number, so fundamental to my exposition, 
        remained vague and obscure. Perhaps the following clarifications will 
        help it become more exact: The concept of number, as I understand it, 
        is at the same time quantity (or a pure nexus undetermined in terms of 
        quality, as Husserl defined it in his Philosophy of Arithmetic) and form, 
        or qualitative number as understood by the ancient Pythagoric school (see 
        Santos, M&aacute;rio Ferreira dos. Pit&aacute;goras e o Tema do N&uacute;mero. 
        2nd ed. S&atilde;o Paulo: Matese, 1965. pp. 67-105). In this second meaning, 
        number can also be synonymous with order and relation (or system of relations). 
        In the text, I go from one meaning to the other without any ceremony or 
        previous warning. I know that I explain it, even though I do not justify 
        it, by saying that the text was originally intended to be read only by 
        my students, who, being used to the double understanding of the word, 
        would not face any difficulty in making the correct choice according to 
        the context.</font></i></font></p>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099">The 
        question of the literary genres has been disputed for centuries. It is 
        one of the most important matters in the Theory of Literature. While excusing 
        ourselves from the narration of the historical evolution of the debate, 
        we will present a summary of the problem and of the solutions we will 
        offer.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099">Should 
        those solutions seem scandalously new to scholars in the field, we assure 
        that any attempt to novelty is far from our intention. We have limited 
        ourselves to applying to the study of an old question the ontological 
        principles which are old as the world.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099"><a name="t2"></a><font size="3"><b>I. 
        Formulating the question</b></font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099">The 
        first reason we have to believe that there are the literary genres is 
        that many authors, such as Aristotle and Boileau, have written treatises 
        to expose the rules that define them.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099">The 
        second reason is that these rules have been followed by thousands of writers 
        for many centuries, and so, for that reason, we are able to find works 
        which perfectly exemplify the classic conception of Lyric, Tragedy etc.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099">The 
        first reason we may have for believing there are no the literary genres 
        is that there is an equally large amount of works, old and modern, but 
        above all modern, that do not fit perfectly in any of the genres defined 
        by the treatises.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099">The 
        second reason is that some authors, the Italian philosopher Benedetto 
        Croce as a case in point, say that genres do not exist . In the understanding 
        of these authors, only individual works exist<a name="r1"></a><sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup>, 
        which are taken account of by history, and a posteriori can be subjected 
        by the scholar to some dubious classification according to their differences 
        and similarities, which, being in their turn so varied and large in number 
        as the works themselves, do not amount to groups constant and distinct 
        enough to be labelled as 'genres'.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099">The 
        third reason is that many writers, knowing the first two reasons, decided 
        to write their books in a way that deliberately escapes the rules and 
        regulations of all known genres. Thus exception has become rule and rule 
        exception; and the systematic mess that followed seemed to provide extensive 
        confirmation to Croce's argument.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099">The 
        problem of genres is similar to the dispute between Realism and Nominalism: 
        do universal concepts express realities which exist by themselves, extra 
        mentis, or are they just a mental assembling of common characteristics 
        that a more or less happy circumstance allowed us to distinguish in various 
        individual beings? Are universals 'real beings' or mere 'reason beings'? 
        Is there a horsehood or just horses? Is there a trianglehood or just triangles? 
        Likewise, are the literary genres universal and necessary structures underlying 
        all possible literary invention, or are they nothing more than mere formal 
        conventions laid down by habit, comfort, and sometimes by pretentiousness?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099"><a name="t3"></a><font size="3"><b>II. 
        Some contemporary opinions</b></font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099">Some 
        contemporary scholars are inclined to compromising solutions. In their 
        work, <i>Theory of Literature</i>, today a classic, Ren&eacute; Wellek 
        and Austin Warren state that.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099">'<i>The 
        literary kind is an 'institution' - as Church, University or State is 
        an institution. It exists, not as an animal exists or even as a building, 
        chapel, library, or capitol, but as an institution exists. One can work 
        through, express oneself through, existing institutions, create new ones, 
        or get on, so far as possible, without sharing in polities or rituals; 
        one can also join, but then reshape, institutions.</i></font></p>
      <p><i><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099">Theory 
        of genres is a principle of order: it classifies literature and literary 
        history... by specifically literary types of organization and structure...</font></i></p>
      <p><i><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099">Do 
        genres remain fixed? Presumably not.'<a name="r2"></a><a href="#n2"><sup>2</sup></a></font></i></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099">This 
        position deserves the credit of distinguishing between a physical, individual 
        mode of existence, and a non-physical, or 'institutional' mode of existence, 
        putting genres in the latter. It is certainly better than denying the 
        existence of genres after looking for signs of them where they were not 
        to be found. However, all in all, this distinction is no other than the 
        same there is between individual works and genres - between horses and 
        horsehood -, names only changing. Individual works exist like animals 
        and buildings exist; genres, like institutes of zoological research and 
        schools of architecture. That does not absolutely explain where genres 
        come from, or whether they emanate from a necessity inherent to the real 
        order of things, or from a mere human desire of systematisation and comfort. 
        The problem continues: in order to know about the origin and worth of 
        zoology institutes, it is not enough just to realise they are not a kind 
        of animal.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099">The 
        Brazilian critic Masaud Mois&eacute;s, giving a very up-to-date account 
        of this debate, comes a little closer to the solution when he says that 
        genres are born from 'a kind of natural imposition, something like the 
        adjustment of the individual to the cosmic rhythm, marked by an unchanging 
        regularity'<a name="r3"></a><a href="#n3"><sup>3</sup></a>. However, even 
        though he explains that 'the reiteration of an expressive module obeys 
        an innate tendency to order that exists in man', and even though he quotes 
        in his support Emil Staiger, to whom genres 'represent fundamental possibilities 
        of human existence in general'<a name="r4"></a><a href="#n4"><sup>4</sup></a> 
        , he does not explain what is this 'something', nor what is the intrinsic 
        relationship between genres and the cosmic rhythm. So it is that the 'thing', 
        being so vague and imprecise, does not offer the least resistance to his 
        writing lines after that that genres were 'invented by certain writers', 
        apparently without realising he's contradicting himself. In fact, were 
        it the way he puts it, we would have to believe that until someone had 
        the kindness of inventing genres, all writers lived outside the cosmic 
        rhythm, and that would have been quite a disaster. It is therefore clear 
        that we must distinguish between the 'cosmic phenomenon' of genres (man's 
        innate tendency to reiterate certain expressive modules, in obedience 
        to an implacable regularity of nature) and the formal concept or verbal 
        definition of genres, which simply translates in logical language the 
        more or less consistent appearance of this phenomenon. The concept, the 
        verbal definition, may have been invented by men, but the actual phenomenon, 
        if it comes from nature, was not invented by anyone, unless we are talking 
        about God or we understand the verb 'to invent' in its original Latin 
        meaning - inveniere meant 'to discover', 'to find' -, depriving it of 
        all connotation of creation and artificial construction. And the problem 
        in dispute is precisely that of knowing whether the concept of genres, 
        as it has been set forth by 'certain writers', actually portrays a real 
        relationship between human expressive modules and the cosmic regularity, 
        or if, on the contrary, genres are nothing but a set of arbitrary rules, 
        beings of reason with no fundamentum in re. If the relationship exists, 
        genres are a necessity, a 'constant of the human spirit'; and the fact 
        that people eventually write books that do not fit in any genre does not 
        deny in any way the existence of genres just like the existence of illnesses 
        does not deny the laws of physiology, rather demonstrating them through 
        a contrario proof: no matter how occult and disguised they may be under 
        the thick layers of inventive and extravagant combinations, genres will 
        always remain the fundamental principles of all literary composition. 
        If, on the contrary, the relationship does not exist, then genres do not 
        reflect any cosmological or ontological necessity, being nothing but a 
        rule invented after the preferences of a certain time, which we may follow 
        or not as we please, running no risk at all of subverting the cosmic order.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099">The 
        whole problem amounts, therefore, to knowing if there are ontological 
        or cosmological laws of which genres are an extension, a manifestation 
        or expression at the level of the literary and linguistic microcosm, or 
        if they just do not exist at all.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099"><a name="t4"></a><font size="3"><b>III. 
        The mode of existence of genres</b></font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099">In 
        our understanding, such laws do exist; and the mode of existence of genres, 
        if it is not similar to that of animals, is neither similar to those of 
        'institutions' of human society, which are contingent and more or less 
        conventional. Genres exist, not like the Rotary Club or the city budget, 
        but in the same way that the laws of logic exist. These laws are immutable 
        in themselves, but can be indefinitely applied and combined, even in ways 
        that can lead to perfectly illogical results. The fact that people may 
        perform wrong ratiocinations does not prove that they are thinking 'without' 
        logic, but only that they, even with logic, think poorly, being unable 
        to handle the laws of reason, which they even so cannot escape; for, if 
        they could, their illogical reasoning would never allow itself to be refuted 
        as being wrong, since there would be no criteria for correct reasoning; 
        and, actually, the study of wrong ratiocinations is part of the science 
        of logic.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099">The 
        literary genres neither exist 'in themselves', like substances in the 
        scholastic understanding of the word, neither are a posteriori generalisations 
        obtained from more or less fortuitous similarities among individual works, 
        neither rules dictated by the arbitrary taste of an age. They are sets 
        of possibilities<a name="r5"></a><a href="#n5"><sup>5</sup></a> for the 
        organisation of literary works. Their mode of existence and action consists 
        in establishing the boundaries of the possibilities of literary invention, 
        differentiating it in a certain number of directions and orientations 
        which, once taken, necessarily bring specific consequences to the posterior 
        development of the work, restricting the author's range of arbitrary decision; 
        and the ability the author possesses to account for these consequences 
        without distancing himself from his central goal produces a final standard 
        of internal coherence, which is the means which will render us able to 
        judge the work according to its own laws, freely chosen by the author 
        among the number of possible genres and combinations.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099">We 
        can say that genres exist and differ among themselves like the directions 
        of space. If a man goes North, he necessarily distances himself from South; 
        and even though he might come and go as many times he wants, North will 
        always be opposite to South, and perpendicular to East and West. The pattern 
        of the trail depends on each one's liberty, but it is necessarily staked 
        out by the extreme directions. Genres are thus the extreme differences 
        among the many possibilities of literary structuring; as we advance ourselves 
        coherently along one of those lines of direction, the harder - but never 
        impossible - it becomes to combine it with others: the more the essential 
        nucleus of a work is strictly committed to the rules of a genre, the harder 
        it will be, in composing the rest, to escape those rules or to combine 
        them in a creative and effective manner with those of some other genre. 
        It is like a chess game: once a direction for the game is defined, an 
        ever greater skill is required to be able to revoke the consequences which 
        threaten to follow irrevocably suit at every new turn<a name="r6"></a><a href="#n6"><sup>6</sup></a> 
        . The artist's ability consists either in coherently following up to the 
        end the rules of the chosen direction, or in intelligently combining them 
        with other possible directions<a name="r7"></a><a href="#n7"><sup>7</sup></a> 
        , creating mixed textures. However, even in the richest and most inventive 
        mixture, the laws of genres would, at least latently, always remain active 
        as articulating principles and minimum elements of which the mixture is 
        composed.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099">But 
        Wellek and Warren's emphasis on the difference between the mode of existence 
        of individual works and that of genres still can prove worth a look. Individual 
        works are beings, or substances, produced by man. They exist because they 
        were written, and they only exist after being written. Genres, in their 
        turn, are sets of possibilities, and as such exist before and independently 
        of anyone doing anything whatsoever. For a possibility to exist, it is 
        enough that it not be impossible - and being theoretically possible, escaping 
        the absolute impossibility even if through a little tiny fringe of possibility, 
        is certainly easier than actually writing a book, as anyone who has ever 
        tried knows well. For a set of possibilities to exist, it is enough that 
        it remains sufficiently distinguishable from other sets; for the mode 
        of existence of a set of possibilities consists in nothing more than being 
        a clear standard of differentiation between some possibilities and others; 
        as long as this difference exists, the set exists. If that is so, genres 
        are indestructible, no matter how many mixed works are written and how 
        difficult it may become, in practice, to distinguish them inside the mixture. 
        Only the absolute impossibility - in theory, not in practice - would authorise 
        us to speak of the 'non-existence of genres'. But this will obviously 
        never happen, because genres derive from an ontological necessity, that 
        is, from the conditions that stake out and determine the physical cosmos 
        wholly considered; and their suppression, were it possible, would result 
        in an actual cosmic mess. It is not by chance that the difficulty to define 
        genres and the following proclamation of their extinction arrive at the 
        peak of an age that harbours every sort of eschatological omens.</font></p>

        modern quest for 'interdisciplinarity' sometimes makes us forget that, 
        for the ancient peoples, all knowledge was always interdisciplinary. They 
        simply could not conceive of some 'specialised' piece of knowledge, independent

        order to understand correctly even the smallest and most particular concept 
        of Aristotelian, Scholastic, Chinese or Islamic sciences, it is necessary 
        to render it back to the universal, metaphysical principles in which it 
        is grounded, for any such concept never is anything other than their explanation 
        or example in a specific and restricted domain<a name="r8"></a><a href="#n8"><sup>8</sup></a>.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099">After 
        that, it is necessary to find out what is the level, what is the place 
        of this concept - of the thing conceptualised - in the 'great chain of 
        Being', that is, in the scale of planes of reality that descend from the 
        Absolute to the most particular and contingent domains of experience. 
        The acceptance of metaphysical principles in every science, and a cosmology 
        that divides the universe in an indefinite number of planes or concentric 
        spheres, are characteristics present in all ancient or traditional cultures.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099">If 
        we do not consider this, any concept of the ancient science we might study 
        will be floating in space like some gratuitous and inexplicable enigma, 
        an arbitrary creation of a primitive and barbaric mind that turned science 
        into a slave of taste and fantasy. And obviously we do not believe that 
        contemporary men are the first intelligent people ever to appear on the 
        face of this Earth, or that the fact that we came after the ancients grants 
        us a feeling of superiority absolutely unjustified by our deeds. Much 
        of the modern attitude towards genres comes simply from the ignorance 
        of their ontological foundations in the old science.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099">The 
        metaphysical principal par excellence is the Absolute, or Infinite, or 
        Universal Possibility. The Infinite - as we will call it from now on - 
        is a necessarily unique principle (for we cannot conceive of two infinites), 
        unlimited in every direction, necessary by definition (for a contingent 
        infinite would be a limited infinite, therefore finite). We speak of the 
        metaphysical Infinite and not of a presumed 'mathematical' infinite, which 
        is limited to quantity and for that very reason is not an infinite properly 
        speaking, but only a metaphorical one, or of second degree: infinitum 
        secundum quid, 'infinite under a certain aspect', as used to say the Scholastics<a name="r9"></a><a href="#n9"><sup>9</sup></a>.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099">The 
        Infinite comprises and transcends, in its absolutely unlimited possibility, 
        all dimensions and directions of the finite. And finite beings, being 
        derived from the Infinite, thus can neither be identical to it, nor be 
        radically different from it, that is, not have any point of contact with 
        it. Beings are neither identical nor different from Infinite: they are 
        analogous to it. The main connection between finite beings and the Infinite 
        is the notion of oneness, which is a characteristic common to both. All 
        that exists has oneness, because if it does not possess oneness, it is 
        two and therefore has no consistency, no cohesion. The attribute 'being' 
        and the attribute 'oneness' are, for that reason, said to be mutually 
        convertible: to all that is attributed being, is also attributed oneness 
        and vice-versa. Ens et unum convertuntur. However, the oneness of the 
        Infinite is absolute (being inseparable) and simple (not being composed 
        of parts), whereas that of finite beings is composite (always being constituted 
        of parts or aspects) and relative (being separable, when the being is 
        extinguished)<a name="r10"></a><a href="#n10"><sup>10</sup></a>.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099">Hence 
        that every finite being, whatever be its place in the 'great chain of 
        Being', has with Infinite two kinds of simultaneous relationships: on 
        the one hand, the essential continuity, that is, the ultimate oneness 
        of its essence with the Infinite's essence, for we could not, without 
        contradiction, conceive of a being which essence is totally separated 
        from Infinite; on the other hand, the existential discontinuity, because 
        finite beings, being one with Infinite through their essence, are distinguished 
        and distanced from it according to their conditions, forms, levels, planes 
        and modes of existence, which, descending from universality to particularity, 
        from necessity to contingency, from permanence to fleetingness, compose 
        precisely what is called 'the great chain of Being'<a name="r11"></a><a href="#n11"><sup>11</sup></a>.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099">Thus 
        from the absolute limitlessness of Universal Possibility to the most restricted 
        areas of contingent existence are disposed successive degrees of possibility, 
        or 'worlds'. Each one of these worlds is therefore defined by a set of 
        limitations or conditions that define what, in their proper domains, is 
        possible or impossible.<br>
        That which we call 'our world', the world of sensible human experience, 
        is defined by three conditions: time, space, and number or quantity. There 
        is nothing, in the whole extent of the physical world, that is not subjected 
        to the imperious law that ordains it to be in some place and not in other, 
        during some time and no more, and to be limited to a certain quantity 
        under all aspects<a name="r12"></a><a href="#n12"><sup>12</sup></a>.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099">These 
        limitations evidently do not befall only on beings, but on all their actions 
        and manifestations as well. So it is that human intelligence, even though 
        it may even be able to grasp some mysterious, instantaneous and unexpressed 
        realities that are well above the conditions of time, space and number 
        (without which it would never be able to grasp the notions of 'Infinite' 
        or 'essence'), will have to subject itself to these same conditions in 
        order to be able to manifest or express itself, in the form of thought, 
        speech or action. Now, the written manifestations of the human mind would 
        not be able to escape these universal conditionings, nor how to exist 
        without differentiating themselves in patterns defined according to time, 
        space and number. These patterns are precisely the principle of genres.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099">The 
        three 'conditions of bodily existence' mentioned by the traditional and 
        particularly Hindu doctrines frame and shape all structures of human perception 
        and action. For that very reason there is not, among all functions of 
        perception and action, any one that cannot, ultimately, be reduced - at 
        least in its logical concept - to some modality of number, space and time 
        (eg. vision remits us to simultaneity, hearing to succession, walking 
        to succession, apprehension to simultaneity, generation to number etc.). 
        The same, necessarily, happens with language. From the basic distinction 
        between name (simultaneity) and verb (succession), everything refers to 
        combinations and complications obtained from these three principles. Similarly, 
        when man first began to write down his thoughts, the modalities in which 
        he could do it had to be differentiated according to the three conditions 
        of bodily existence.</font></p>

        Verse and prose</b></font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099">The 
        most general of genres, comprising all others (and for the same reason, 
        being 'genres of genres', should be more properly named categories) are 
        verse and prose. The distinction between verse and prose mirrors on the 
        level of the literary microcosm the condition of 'number' or quantity. 
        No matter what scholars may have been saying for the past hundred years 
        in endless discussions, the fact is that the distinction of verse and 
        prose is only a distinction between the two most general forms of quantity, 
        continued and discontinued. A verse is a verse as long as some principle 
        of discontinuity or sectioning, be it either rhythmic or metric, prevails, 
        performing some sort of sound reiteration; and prose is prose as it flows 
        without ever returning. Verses are like rain drops, sprinkling repetitively, 
        whereas prose is a river running without interruption. Hence there is 
        a certain 'superiority' in verse, because it 'comes from the heavens' 
        like the discontinued and enigmatic speech of angels and oracles, whereas 
        prose slides along the ground like the everyday talk of men.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099">This 
        distinction reflects, therefore, the principles of the essential continuity 
        and the existential discontinuity between the Infinite and the finite.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099">The 
        traditional symbol of the circle can make it all the more clear. If we 
        represent Being, unique and infinite, by a point, the rays that emanate 
        from it represent its distinct possibilities of manifestations in many 
        directions; they are the qualities or properties that prolong its essence 
        without being separated from it. If, from this point, we draw many concentric 
        circles, they will represent the various levels of nearness and farness 
        in which every point and segment of the rays can be in relation to the 
        central point. The rays represent the essential continuity, and the circles 
        the existential discontinuity; the rays, the oneness of reality; the circles, 
        the multiplicity of planes or levels<a name="r13"></a><a href="#n13"><sup>13</sup></a>. 
        This figure applies to the distinction of verse and prose in a double 
        way, according to the rule of traditional symbolism that always allows 
        for the coexistence of direct and inverse symbolism<a name="r14"></a><a href="#n14"><sup>14</sup></a>. 
        We can say, on the one hand, that the rays express the continuous flow 
        of prose, and their sectioning by the concentric circles the rhythm of 
        verse. On the other, we can see the figure in reverse sense, and say that 
        prose revolves or goes about continuously like planets in their orbit, 
        and that the rays of verse section or scan rhythmically these circles 
        according to the directions of space.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099">The 
        possible combinations of distinct shades of verse and prose must not make 
        us lose the essential distinction, because every combination, no matter 
        how complex, will always be made of continued and discontinued elements.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099">The 
        most recent critical trend is to forget the key role of the quantitative 
        factor - metric or rhythmic - in the distinction of verse and prose, and 
        to search for a semantic type of distinction. That is, with or without 
        metrics and rhyme, a text is considered to be 'poetic' or 'prosaic' according 
        to whether a 'connotative' or 'denotative' use of language prevails; verse 
        is supposed to speak in modo obliquo and prose in modo recto<a name="r15"></a><a href="#n15"><sup>15</sup></a>. 
        This new distinction arose from the need to account for the great amount 
        of works written without any commitment to metric. But, on one side, denotation 
        and connotation are nothing but the semantic equivalents of continuity 
        and discontinuity, as we can see from the direct or indirect - continued 
        or discontinued - reference from signifier to signified. On the other, 
        this is a derived and secondary distinction, and not a primary one. For 
        millennia, poetic works have possessed metrics and rhyme, being either 
        connotative or denotative (even treatises on science and philosophy, which 
        semantically we would call prosaic, were written in poetic forms, without 
        calling the attention of anyone). We could admit, so as to wrap up the 
        question, a fourfold classification, patterned after the crossing of semantic 
        and phonetic criteria: thus, we would have continued-connotative and continued-denotative; 
        discontinued-connotative and discontinued-denotative; and the gradations 
        of these four would easily account for all possible combinations without 
        further complications, which by the way could have been solved from the 
        beginning by the realisation of the ambiguous meaning of the word 'prose', 
        understood as opposed, on one side, to 'verse', and on the other, to 'poetry'.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099">However, 
        according strictly to their origin, verse and prose are not modes of signification, 
        but rather modes of elocution. To avoid any further confusions, we'll 
        say that an intensely 'connotative' text lacking in any sort of rhythmic 
        or metric reiteration, is not verse: it is poetic prose or something alike; 
        and a purely 'denotative' text, such as some purely prosaic and informative 
        lines in the tragedies of Shakespeare and Racine - not to speak of the 
        old treatises of Geometry and Physics composed in rhyme - is verse. In 
        short: continued text, either connotative or denotative, is prose; and 
        discontinued text, either connotative or denotative, is verse, be it 'poetic' 
        or not. If anyone wishes to change that, preferring to employ the semantic 
        criterion, it will not make the least difference; only, in behalf of clarity, 
        we recommend bearing in mind that the distinction of verse and prose refers 
        primarily to elocution, and secondarily (metaphorically, or secundum quid) 
        to signification; and that in going from the direct employment of a concept 
        to its metaphorical employment it is necessary to make adjustments and 
        compensations in order to avoid cheap, mechanical and unintelligent transpositions.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099">From 
        this point of view, we'll see that theoretically all the literary genres 
        can be indifferently put into prose or verse (or in distinct gradations 
        in a combination), and that they in fact have been, according to the taste 
        and the preference of the ages. If today it seems a bit strange to write 
        treatises on Physics with metrics and rhyme, to the ancient Greeks symbolist 
        poetic prose would not seem less strange.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099">We 
        insist that the existence of various gradations of mixture, and even of 
        nearly undecomposable mixtures, does not change anything of the general 
        concept: the fact that Northeast is neither to the North nor to the East 
        does not suppress the existence of North and East, which must remain in 
        place in order for someone to be able to stand in the Northeast. The obsessive 
        cult of exceptions - which ultimately can always be reduced back to the 
        rule, if such a work were worth - does not come from any other thing than 
        the taste for what Ortega y Gasset used to call 'the philosophy of grey 
        cats.'</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099">Before 
        we enter the discussion of specific genres, we must explain that the distinction 
        of genres is altogether different from that of verse and prose. It is 
        a two-folded difference:</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099">1. 
        Verse and prose are differentiated according to number - or order, or 
        relation -; whereas the literary genres are differentiated as they reflect 
        the categories of space and time and the various modalities of space and 
        time. Verse and prose are 'categories', or genres of genres; they comprise 
        all genres just as number comprises space and time.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099">2. 
        If genres are bodies of possibilities, and if these bodies are distinct 
        from each other, then each body defines itself as a principle or rule 
        for the structuring of matter taken as a whole, while verse and prose 
        are principles for the structuring of the smallest parts - sentences and 
        periods - separately considered. A tragedy is a tragedy because the totality 
        of the events narrated necessarily concurs for a tragic outcome according 
        to the rule of tragedy, even though there may be, here and there, along 
        the work, pleasurable or comic elements. But verses are verses because 
        their sentences are sectioned and sewn, one by one, according to some 
        kind of reiterative module; and prose is prose because its sentences follow 
        each other in a continuing flow, with no commitment to reiteration. In 
        order to know whether a work is written in verse or prose, it is enough 
        to read some paragraphs, or even to just look at the text's disposition 
        in the page, whereas to know whether a work is a comedy or a tragedy, 
        unless it is stated on the cover, we must read it entirely and get to 
        know the intimate connections among its elements and levels of meaning.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099">Genres, 
        as we were saying, are bodies of possibilities for the combination of 
        literary matter, and these bodies distinguish themselves from each other 
        as they reflect in their inner structure the two other great dimensions 
        of bodily existence: time and space. Hence the first great division of 
        genres: the temporal or successive mode is expressed in the narrative 
        genres, and the spatial or simultaneous mode in the expository genres. 
        The internal subdivisions of these genres - or, if you will, their species 
        - will be defined, therefore, according to the many modalities of space 
        and time, modalities which, in their turn, are distinguished by number: 
        continued and discontinued. Continued - or unterminated - time, discontinued 
        - or terminated - time: such is the criterion for the distinction of the 
        narrative genres. Continued space - or encompassing totality -, discontinued 
        space - or subdivided in distinct places -: such is the criterion for 
        the distinction of the expository genres.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099">If, 
        as we were saying, the narrative genres manifest the dimension of time, 
        they can, in principle, be rendered either in verse or prose by the very 
        fact that this dimension contains an aspect of continuity as well as another 
        of discontinuity: time flows irrevocably and uninterruptedly, but is sectioned 
        by the quantitative and qualitative distinction of its various moments.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099">Similarly, 
        expository genres can appear in verse or prose as they reflect continued 
        extension or the differentiation in dimensions, planes, places, lines 
        and points (the point, in geometry, coincides both structurally and symbolically 
        with the temporal notion of 'moment' and the arithmetical notion of 'zero'. 
        It is in this 'zero' that dimensions meet, it is in it that their differentiation 
        according to quantitative patterns of continuity of discontinuity begins).<a name="r16"></a><a href="#n16"><sup>16</sup></a></font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099">In 
        order to understand what we are about to say it is necessary to bear in 
        mind that these principles of genres are ontological and not psychological; 
        they need not be present in the author's mind as he writes his work; they 
        stay, so to speak, behind the act of literary creation, staking out its 
        field of possibilities. Any author who is deeply aware of these principles 
        certainly can make deliberate use of them as technical elements; however, 
        even if he does not have the slightest idea about them, they will nevertheless 
        exercise their delimitating action. It may also happen that the artist 
        harmonises himself with them in a totally unconscious way, sufficing that 
        he remains faithful to the formal intention that is his inspiration, for 
        making art is but to give form, and man cannot give form but according 
        to his own form of existing, perceiving, and making.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099">We 
        say that the narrative genre expresses the dimension of time not because 
        all narratives elapse in a uniform flow of time, but rather because even 
        though they may consist of a continued duration, or of a crossing of psychological 
        lapses of time, or of comings and goings between past and present, or 
        of moments of minimum and indefinite extension atomistically taken, and 
        not mattering the immense variety of the modes for the treatment of time 
        in historical or fictional narratives, the most important structuring 
        factor of the narrative is time, and the narrative is the narrative because 
        of it and of nothing else.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099">The 
        eventual interference of expository or spatial elements - as it happens, 
        for example, in the description of settings, in the profiles of characters, 
        or even in the small philosophical essays that authors such as Tolstoi 
        and Dostoievski insert in their novels - does not deprive the work of 
        anything of its narrative character; their presence is explained, ultimately, 
        by the fact that for man there is no other way to perceive and represent 
        time than through the reference of a spatial frame and some movement in 
        it, as anyone who possesses a clock may realise. Strictly speaking, there 
        is no 'pure narration', made only of succession, without any reference 
        to space or simultaneity. Time is time and space is space, but man is 
        man, and in him these two dimensions cross, articulated by number or order.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099">Likewise, 
        expository genres are 'spatial' to the extent that they reflect the simultaneousness 
        of the elements in a logical (or ontological, for it is the same thing) 
        hierarchy. The expository genre is shaped by logical order, abstracting 
        itself, in principle, from the temporal element, from chronological succession. 
        However, just like there is no 'pure narrative', there is no 'pure exposition', 
        because the oral or written exposition of an idea, even when this idea 
        has been grasped in a completely simultaneous way, demands that it be 
        successively unfolded in the forms of reason and speech. Here, impurity 
        too comes from the nature of things: being symbols or manifestations of 
        the cosmic dimensions of space and time, genres could not possess all 
        the notes that define these dimensions, because in that case they would

        Species of the narrative genre</font></b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099">The 
        narrative genres will then differentiate themselves in species according 
        to their internal divisions or modes of temporality. These modes are expressed 
        basically through verbal tenses.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099">The 
        two major modalities of time are defined by the two forms of quantity: 
        continued and discontinued. In almost every ancient language - such as 
        Arabic, Hebrew, Sanskrit and Greek, for example - verbal tenses are divided 
        in two basic forms: one that expresses continuing verbal action, pure 
        flow, without reference to any specific moment, being a kind of 'continuous 
        present' that speaks of an action more or less perennial or cyclical; 
        and a second one that expresses verbal action fixed in a moment of time. 
        Therefore, these two forms manifest, respectively, continuity and discontinuity. 
        This division is quite varied in all languages, but always follows a basic 
        pattern. In Greek, as a case in point, there are primary verbal tenses 
        and one secondary tense: primary tenses are present, past and future, 
        which place the action in distinct moments; the secondary tense is called 
        aoristo, or pure verbal action. In Arabic, the division is even more radical, 
        only two tenses being acknowleged strictly speaking: terminated (m&aacute;di'), 
        'action terminated in a remote time, which result is manifested at this 
        moment', and unterminated (mudari), 'which action does terminate in the 
        present, continuing into the future'<a name="r18"></a><a href="#n18"><sup>18</sup></a>; 
        there is also the imperative ('amr), completely independent from tense 
        and time. Sanskrit follows a division more or less similar to that of 
        Greek.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099">In 
        order to understand these properties of the ancient languages, and their 
        consequences for the theory of genres, it is necessary to be acquainted 
        with the traditional doctrine of 'triple time', which can be found with 
        insignificant variations in the metaphysical teachings of Greece and the 
        East. According to this doctrine, the relations between time and being 
        are echeloned in planes or levels. The highest is eternity, the complete 
        non-existence of time or any kind of flow, the absolute simultaneousness 
        of all moments. Universal Possibility is eternal: the transformations 
        that go in the inferior planes do not diminish nor alter even slightly 
        the infinitude of the possible.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099">In 
        the other end, at the level of particular and sensible beings, there is 
        temporality, the continuing and irreversible flow of individual events 
        that are not repeated. The past does not come back; it is the realm of 
        necessity and destiny, the realm of factum. Between these two zones there 
        is the intermediate zone of cyclical time, a realm that, even though it 
        is subject to flow and to ruin, is periodically reinvigorated by the restoration 
        of the initial possibilities at the moment the cycle is closed, for it 
        is the same moment that it is reopened. It is the realm of perenniality, 
        the intermediate world of archetypal images, the mundus imaginalis, where 
        they live and move according to the laws of perennial return of the mythical 
        beings - such as the signs of the Zodiac and the characters from mythological 
        epop&eacute;es - that express in forms apprehensible by the cognitio imaginativa 
        the archetypes that stake out possibilities of the temporal world<a name="r19"></a><a href="#n19"><sup>19</sup></a>.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099">Eternity 
        is the realm of the divine by excellence, from where descend, through 
        the mediation of the Logos or Divine Intelligence, the determinations 
        which, taking live forms progressively defined in the funnel of perenniality, 
        are finally crystallised as irreversible facts in the temporal order. 
        Eternity is fiat; temporality, factum; and perenniality, the perpetual 
        in fieri.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099">Structurally, 
        therefore, the narrative must express - not necessarily in its content 
        nor in its technique, but always in the principle or establishing rule 
        that makes this technique possible - either perenniality or temporality, 
        because the imperative, the 'amr', is above the possibility of being narrated, 
        or can only be narrated by the mediation of its image in perenniality.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099">So, 
        just as the temporal order is the realm of particular facts, and perenniality 
        the realm of myths and symbols which group these facts in categories that 
        remit to Universal Possibility, the first division of the narrative genres 
        is that existing between factual narratives and symbolic narratives. Factual 
        narratives express what has already happened, is already finished and 
        cannot return. Symbolic narratives express events which, even though they 
        may be metaphorically placed in the past (as they must be in modern languages, 
        deprived of aoristo or mudari), in reality represent possibilities destined 
        to be reactualised. This division corresponds more or less to that which 
        is imprecisely called 'historical' narrative and 'fictional' narrative; 
        we say 'imprecisely' because what distinguishes these two species is not 
        properly the real or fictional nature of events, but rather the fact that 
        the reality of the historical narrative is in that the events have really 
        happened in a past moment, whereas the 'reality' of fictional narrative 
        is in the possibility of a psychological reactualisation of its symbols 
        in the act of reading. When Carlyle tells the story of the death of Louis 
        XV, he wants to make clear that this has already happened and will not 
        happen again; however, when the evangelist tells the story of Christ's 
        death, what he has in mind is not the finished fact, but rather the possibility 
        of its ritual reactualisation in the soul of the Christian; and Desdemona's 
        death, which in fact never happened, is intended to happen in the soul 
        of the spectator when he watches the play. Now, Christ's death was a historical 
        fact as much as the death of Louis XV; the difference is that the evangelist 
        talks about it as a symbol, as a repeatable archetype, while Carlyle only 
        speaks of a past fact. Thus, the narrative of the Gospel and of Carlyle 
        are both historical, while that of Desdemona is fictional; but the Gospel 
        and Othello are symbolical narratives, while Carlyle's book is a factual 
        narrative.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099">The 
        factual narrative comprises thus all the facts which, belonging to the 
        order of temporality and irreversibility, are narrated as such. This includes 
        the works of testimony, chronicles, and memoirs as well as works of History 
        itself. The difference between memoirs and works of History is in the 
        interference of a spatial factor, the narrator's point of view. The writer 
        of memoirs tells things from his own point-of-view, while the historian 
        collects various testimonies (among which can evidently be his own). We 
        can still bring in another spatial difference between the books of memoirs 
        and those of testimony or chronicle, because the first are narrated from 
        the point of view of the author of the actions, whereas the latter are 
        narrated from an observer's point of view. Even though these divisions 
        are spatial in principle, they also have a temporal counterpart to the 
        extent that there is a differentiation between a subjective or personal 
        temporality and a social chronology - being therefore intersubjective.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099">The 
        symbolic narrative species are also divided according to the continued 
        and the discontinued, the terminated and the unterminated. The unterminated 
        species is drama, which, even though narrating an action metaphorically 
        placed in the past, reproduces it in the present by means of the actors' 
        performance on stage.<a name="r20"></a><a href="#n20"><sup>20</sup></a> 
        The terminated modality is what we call epic, or properly narrative (myth, 
        legend, novel, etc.), which does not reproduce the action in the present, 
        but simply evokes it or narrates it as past<a name="r21"></a><a href="#n21"><sup>21</sup></a>.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099">The 
        species of drama is also divided according to the terminated and the unterminated. 
        The terminated subspecies reports itself to the factum, the time that 
        unfolds in the direction of the irreversible concatenation of causes and 
        consequences: it is tragedy, celebrating the victory of necessity and 
        fate over man. When, on the contrary, the chain of factum can be broken 
        by Providence, returning to man initial possibilities which would be lost 
        under the effect of irreversibility, we have the subspecies of comedy<a name="r22"></a><a href="#n22"><sup>22</sup></a>.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099">Likewise, 
        terminated narrative or epic genres are divided according to the modality 
        of time that informs them:</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099">1. 
        The mythical subspecies expresses events that occurred 'in that time' 
        (in illo tempore), that is, in the mythical time of perenniality and of 
        the mundus imaginalis. This is the real time of the Biblical and Koranic 
        narratives, as well as of the Greek myths.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099">2. 
        At the other end, we have the novelesque genre (novels and short stories), 
        which is definitely delimited by terrestrial temporality (no matter how 
        creative is technical treatment the narrator gives to time).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099">3. 
        Between both, we can admit an intermediate species, composed of jests 
        and legends, which, dealing essentially with the divinisation of a human 
        hero, establish a bridge between temporality and perenniality. Novels 
        of 'initiatic' content are evidently likely to offer difficulties for 
        classification, hesitating between the novelesque and the legendary. What's 
        best, in almost all cases, is to call them legends disguised as novels.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099">The 
        enormous development of the novelesque species in the modern age, parallel 
        to the retraction of legends, is a sign of the progressive loss of the 
        sense of perenniality in our civilisation. This loss occurs concomitantly 
        to the spread of modern European languages deprived of aoristo, and to 
        the loss of symbolical understanding of the universe in favour of a more 
        terrestrial experience, temporalised and empirical, in the transition 
        from the medieval worldview to that of the Renaissance.</font></p>

        Species of the expository genre</b></font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099">Just 
        as narratives are classified according to the continuity or discontinuity 
        of time, the expository species are also differentiated according to the 
        continuity or discontinuity of the spatial and simultaneous whole that 
        represents the logical and ontological order. If the continuity and the 
        discontinuity of time were expressed in the concepts of 'terminated and 
        unterminated' and in the corresponding verbal tenses, the concepts equivalent 
        to the spatial order are the notions of whole and part, and of inclusion 
        and exclusion.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099">We 
        will provide here but a schematic outline of the expository genre, but 
        we believe that these minimum criteria can be indefinitely applied in 
        successive divisions of species and subspecies, accounting for all possible 
        combinations.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099">Expository 
        works then are divided at first on those dealing with the 'whole' and 
        those dealing with 'the part'; and each of them is subdivided according 
        to whether its subject is dealt with in an 'including' or 'excluding' 
        manner.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099">The 
        notions of 'whole' and 'inclusion' give the shape of all literary species 
        that possess a nature of list, of index, of inventory, of accumulation 
        and enumeration, which model is by excellence the enciclop&aelig;dia. 
        They are works that are ultimately destined to contain 'everything', or 
        as much possible: de omne re scibili. Belonging to this species are all 
        subspecies of didactic and informative works, ranging from Natural History 
        by Plinius the Old, to the Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica, including Saint 
        Isidore's Etymologies.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099">Opposed 
        to the indiscriminate encompassing of the list, the idea of system, or 
        of organisation, is also aimed towards a 'whole', but a whole that is 
        separated and ranked in its parts, aspects and dimensions, being therefore 
        subjected to a sequence of 'exclusions'. This is the treatise or systematic 
        species. Aristotle's Organon, for example, is a treatise, and so is the 
        Summa Theologica by Saint Thomas of Aquinas, or Euclides's Elements; each 
        one these works intends to enclose the totality of a subject, but systematising 
        it according to its constitutive and intrinsic parts, and not just list 
        them after some casual, extrinsic and convenient order as in the encyclop&aelig;dias.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099">On 
        the other end, we have the works patterned after the idea of part or aspect. 
        These are works which focus on a specific phenomenon, or group of phenomena, 
        an idea or a particular group of ideas, without the purpose of creating 
        a system of total knowledge. But even this approach to the part can be 
        done according to two modalities: inclusion or exclusion.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099">On 
        one side, there are the works which, dealing with a particular subject, 
        intend to insert it in a pre-existent body of knowledge, which has already 
        been systematised. For example, when Apolonius of Perga writes his treatise 
        on Cones, he does not intend to build a complete geometric system, nor 
        to just throw a few ideas: he intends to fit these ideas in a precise 
        place of the pre-existent body of geometric science; and this goal directs 
        and informs the treatment he gives to his subject, which must be a systematic 
        treatment according to the concepts and norms admitted in Geometry. This 
        species of works is denominated thesis, which comes from a Latin verb 
        that means 'to put'. He who makes a thesis is putting a piece in a pre-existent 
        frame, and the piece's shape must be perfectly adjusted to the specific 
        hole it intends to fill.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099">However, 
        if the idea to be presented has no formal or decisive commitment with 
        a pre-existent system of knowledge, then what the author does is to freely 
        add one more idea to the extensive and vague repertoire of human ideas. 
        This is precisely what the species essay does.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099">The 
        differentiation of the expository species may thus go on indefinitely, 
        by means of the sheer application of the criteria of whole and part, inclusion 
        and exclusion. There is an infinity of possible mixtures as well. It is 
        unnecessary to proceed with the enumeration, for we believe to have proved 
        the effectiveness of the criteria. Just to give an idea of the possibilities 
        of developments: the essay species can be subdivided according to whether 
        the essay is more or less committed to some pre-existent scientific criteriology: 
        Science as Vocation, Politics as Vocation and other works collected in 
        Weber's Essays of Sociology differ thus from Montaigne's Essays because 
        the first are closer to 'exclusion' and the second to 'inclusion'. And 
        so on. It is not necessary, at this moment, to carry the criteria forward 
        to more detailed applications.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099"><a name="t10"></a><font size="3"><b>IX. 
        The lyrical genre. Conclusion</b></font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099">It 
        really is necessary to say a word about the lyrical genre, which seems 
        to have been mysteriously left out of our arrangement. What happens with 
        lyric is that, strictly speaking, it is not patterned after simultaneity 
        or succession, neither after space or time. On the contrary, it is defined 
        precisely by its supra-spatial and supra-temporal character. Either in 
        the form of verse or prose, lyric expresses the only terrestrial equivalent 
        of the dimension that surpasses both perenniality and temporality; it 
        is structured after the aspiration for eternity, and its formal module 
        is the concept of 'moment', having 'point' as a spatial equivalent, an 
        expression of what arithmetically is the unit.<a name="r23"></a><a href="#n23"><sup>23</sup></a> 
        Lyric takes a moment in time, a point in space, and projects it in the 
        non-time and the non-space. That in order to do this it has to make use 
        of verbal instruments derived from space and time, from continuity and 
        discontinuity, from the successive and simultaneous, is what defines precisely 
        the limits of the humanly expressible and the mutual annihilation of time 
        and space in the crossing of the 'point' or 'moment'.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099">Lyric 
        is, therefore, the purest expression of relation, or order, or number, 
        that is, the dimension that articulates, comprises and contains space 
        and time.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2" color="#000099">The 
        literary genres, strictly speaking, are archetypical realities: they frame 
        and guide the multiplicity of facts in literary history, without ever 
        being manifest in their whole purity - for temporality imitates perenniality 
        without being able to identify with it - and also without ever totally 
        vanishing away, no matter how unrecognisable they may be behind the usually 
        confusing multitude of particular facts and variations. The difficulty 
        felt by the contemporary man in understanding genres and recognising them 
        in the midst of the confusion of empirical data is exactly the same he 
        has to find any archetypal meaning in the facts of a daily life that has 
        been entirely trivialised and reified, cut from the realm of archetypes 
        by the smoke and the noise of commercial and industrial instantaneousness, 
        as well as by the polluting distortions the mass communications industry 
        criminally introduces in the world of images and symbols. The difficulty 
        in seeing in the subject and not in the object.</font></p>

        Purism and an intelligent combination of different genres can both deliver 
        good results. The two greatest literary works of the Portuguese literary 
        renaissance - Antonio Ferreira's Castro and Lu&iacute;s de Cam&otilde;es's 
        Os Lus&iacute;adas - follow each one these two strategies, respectively. 
        Ferreira wished to write a tragedy that attained in the strictest fashion 
        to Aristotelian rule, and with that he obtained the tremendous dramatic 
        concentration that makes his play one of the works of greatest impact 
        in Portuguese language. Cam&otilde;es, in his turn, unable to follow by 
        the book the model of mythical (Homeric) epop&eacute;e in face of the 
        chosen historical topic, articulated mythical narrative with historical 
        chronicle, producing a work with two parallel strata without match in 
        world literature. On Os Lus&iacute;adas as an 'impure epop&eacute;e', 
        see Saraiva, Ant&ocirc;nio Jos&eacute;. 'Os Lus&iacute;adas e o ideal 
        da epop&eacute;ia'. Para a Hist&oacute;ria da Cultura em Portugal. 5th

        sciences are the body of methods and knowledge which, in every known civilisation 
        - including the West up to the sixteenth century - unfold in coherent 
        manner in every direction from a central core of metaphysical principles, 
        and which intend to reveal, on all more or less contingent orders of reality, 
        the eternal and immutable validity of these same principles' (p. 53).</font></p>

        Rio de Janeiro: di Giorgio, 1983. Vol. I, pp. 152-153. Aoristos literally 
        means 'indefinite', 'undetermined'. It is derived from orisma, meaning 
        'limit', 'frontier', 'term' and 'definition', from which are also derived 
        the words 'hour' and 'horizon'. The study of Greek myths related to the 
        horizon as limit between Heavan and Earth shows the inseparable link between 
        the 'unterminated' verbal tense - aoristo - and the perennial time of 
        mythology. Cf. Souza, Eudoro de. Horizonte e Complementaridade. S&atilde;o 
        Paulo: Duas Cidades, 1978.</font></p>

        It is therefore obvious that film narrative is included in the subspecies 
        'symbolic unterminated species'.</font></p>

        It is also obvious that romances and short stories written in the present 
        tense are inspired in a technique that is ultimately cinematographic; 
        and that, as in them the present tense of verbs does not grant real actuality 
        to events which are really just being narrated and not shown, the supposed 
        'present time' is metaphorical and not real as in theatre. But, in a certain 
        way, the 'present time' of film is also metaphorical, because the actors 
        are not really acting at the moment the spectator watches the movie.</font></p>

        We see no need to deepen in the essence of every particular genre, for 
        this is not the purpose of our work; we only intend to show the ontological 
        foundation of the very idea of genres. Maybe it would be interesting for 
        the reader to compare our arrangement with that of Northrop Frye in Anatomy 
        of Critic, Chapter IV, whose angle is different from ours, but not opposed.</font></p>
