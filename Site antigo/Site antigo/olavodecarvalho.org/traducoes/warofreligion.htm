      <p align=left><b>For Bin Laden, the Koran was always a pretext</b></p>
      <p align=left>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>On September 24, Osama Bin Laden said that American forces were entering 
        Afghanistan under the “flag of the Cross.” Two days later, he called George 
        W. Bush the “leader of the unfaithful.” This should be enough to show 
        that his allegation of “holy war” was never more than a smokescreen, an 
        ideological disguise.</p>
      <p>According to the Koran, no one can be Christian and unfaithful at the 
        same time. Christians and Jews are clearly included in the Koranic category 
        of “people of the Book” (ahl al-kitab), recognized as a type of Muslim 
        <i>avant la lettre. </i>Their salvation is assured, in unequivocal terms 
        in Sura V:69: “Those who believe [in the Koran], those who follow Jewish 
        scripture, and the Christians – and those who believe in God and on Judgment 
        Day – should fear nothing, for they will not be harmed.”</p>
      <p>A conscious Muslim can say that the message received from God by the 
        “people of the Book” is incomplete, that they don’t follow it correctly, 
        but not that they’re “unfaithful” or “idolaters.”</p>
      <p>In truth, Islam is accused of strict sectarianism but is the most ecumenical 
        of religions: the succession of prophets, from Adam to Mohammed, includes 
        and legitimizes all monotheistic religions conceived as historical peaks 
        of a single revelation culminating in “Laylat-al-Qadr,” the “Night of 
        Power,” when the archangel Gabriel began to dictate the verses of the 
        Koran to Mohammed. “Unfaithful,” strictly speaking, applies only to atheists, 
        polytheists, and monotheists who in bad faith extort the differences between 
        their respective doctrines and the Koranic message to denigrate the Koran 
        instead of cherishing the mystery of unity in diversity.</p>
      <p>In calling Bush one time a Christian and the other unfaithful, Bin Laden 
        showed himself incapable of speaking as a serious religious person, instead 
        as someone trying to speak against his adversary and who, enraged, chooses, 
        any old thing, which shows a clear contradiction.</p>
      <p>Is anything else necessary to show that this man’s opposition to the 
        West was never based on valid Koranic justification, rather something 
        else, which employed Koranic propaganda to ornament his rhetoric and cover 
        up an evil political ambition in religious semblance? </p>
      <p>At the same time, these considerations discredit historian Paul Johnson’s 
        anti-Muslim tirade which gave involuntary support both to enemies of Islam 
        as those of Israel and the West. In trying to show the radical hostility 
        of Islam against other religions, especially Christianity, Johnson cited 
        Sura IX:5: “Kill the idolaters wherever they are found, and capture them, 
        and surround them, and use traps against them.” Even in the most general 
        sense, the term “idolaters” does not apply to monotheistic cultures. This 
        passage especially refers to the polytheists of Mecca mentioned in the 
        earlier verse who “signed a pact with you [Mohammed] and later failed 
        to respect it.” These are the ones Mohammed should pursue, capture, and 
        kill, as he did according to historical record. But, even the use of force 
        was not unlimited in this case, because Mohammed immediately halted any 
        persecution of his enemies when he entered Mecca, condemning to death 
        only the five key figures and forgiving all others – certainly the lightest 
        war reparation of all time. So, one of them has misinterpreted the verse: 
        Mohammed or Paul Johnson. It’s true that a reading similar to Johnson’s 
        was used by Muslim chiefs to incite violence against Christians, but obviously 
        they were far from the Prophet’s interpretation and, since the acts and 
        words of the Prophet are the highest source of authority in Koranic code, 
        clearly these men, like Bin Laden, were not very orthodox Muslims.</p>
