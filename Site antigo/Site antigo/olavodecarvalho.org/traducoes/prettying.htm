      <h4>They are trying to lighten up the bad impression of the involvement 
        with drugs</h4>
      <p>The arrest of Luiz Fernando “Beira-Mar”da Costa in an encampment of Colombian 
        guerrillas, with proof of exchange of drugs for guns, was maybe the most 
        fearsome thing that has happened to the national Left since the death 
        of Carlos Lamarca and Carlos Marighella (the two most famous left-wing 
        Brazilian terrorists). Beira-Mar is a living file of the dangerous liaisons 
        between bandits and the revolution, and because of that some journalists 
        – always so anxious to search in the attics and basements for things to 
        destroy the career of right-wing politicians – are so circumspect and 
        evasive regarding the drug dealer. If he knew anything capable of incriminating 
        Antonio Carlos Magalhães, Paulo Maluf, or any other top right wing politician, 
        the reporters would be on top of him day and night. Since what he knows 
        is against the left, there are in the press people that even protest against 
        the highlight the news of his arrest is getting from in some newspapers 
        and magazines.  </p>
      <p>Others are not content in simply suppressing the news: they move on to 
        active misinformation. According to a note reproduced in several publications 
        last week, the representative of the United Nations’ Program for the International 
        Control of Drugs, Klaus Nyholm, would have said that the Farc do not act 
        as drug dealers, limiting themselves to charge a tax  “for all the cocaine 
        that leaves Colombian territory”, and that the paramilitary troops of 
        the extreme right, these are the ones that have direct involvement with 
        drug dealing, from which they obtain from US$ 200 million to US$ 500 million 
        per year. </p>
      <p>The first part of this statement is true, but Nyholm made it long ago, 
        for it was already used as a citation in a Noam Chomsky article from June 
        2000. With the falsified date, it serves now as a buffer against the impact 
        of the evidence found with Beira-Mar. But who will this fool? Even if 
        they did not participate directly in the drug dealing, the Farc would 
        be even more criminal than the drug dealers, since they have dominated 
        and reduced them to the condition of subjects, becoming the higher leaders 
        and beneficiaries of this illicit commerce.  </p>
      <p>As to the second part of the statement, Nyholm simply could not have 
        made it. No one that did not intend to denounce himself as a liar or a 
        mental retard would affirm that the Farc receive a tax “from all cocaine 
        that comes out of Colombia” only to announce, right in the next sentence, 
        that a considerable part of this whole comes from their greatest enemy. 
        Because then the poor fellow would have to explain if the extreme right 
        pays tax to the communist guerrilla or if they have invented a way to 
        avoid paying their dues.   </p>
      <p>Only the communist hunger to lie can make a journalist so blind to the 
        puerile absurdity of what he invents.  However, it would be imprudent 
        to explain through the radical ravenousness of isolated individuals the 
        leftist bias that deforms a good part of the circulating news. The situation 
        reflects a rational, conscious strategy, bent on the conquest of the media 
        since the sixties, when the ideas of Antonio Gramsci, theoretician of 
        the “occupation of spaces”, entered Brazil. In 1993, CUT (<i>Central Única 
        dos Trabalhadores</i> – Central Workers Union) already admitted to have 
        in its payroll nothing less than 800 journalists – enough to produce seven 
        editions per week of a weekly magazine like <i>Época</i>! Add to that 
        the ones that work for PT, for MST and the hundreds of millionaire left-wing 
        Non-Governmental Organizations (without anything comparable, even remotely, 
        counterbalancing this phenomenon on the side of the right) – and you will 
        see the class of the journalists widely subjugated to the interests of 
        a political faction that is not famous by the transparency either of its 
        plans to pull down the state, or of the financial means they will use 
        to do that.  </p>
      <p>Regardless of their allegations of “ethics”, many left-wing journalists 
        are going too far in the practice of the Leninist rule that the ends justify 
        the means. Some of them are not even aware that what they are doing is 
        evil and dishonest. They simply identify the right with evil and feel 
        that lying against it is no sin. But “lying in defense of the truth” was 
        the numbing pretext that led many good men to collaborate with the genocide 
        of a hundred million victims.</p>
