      <p>A few weeks ago I mentioned in passing the maxim of Sun-Tzu: “Appear 
        weak when you’re strong, and strong when you’re weak.” It sums up the 
        key behind timing, the rhythmic alternation in Communist rhetoric. Anatoliy 
        Golitsyn, the KGB defector and probably greatest mind on the subject in 
        the Western media, provides the following interpretation: when the Communist 
        movement is involved in some long-term global maneuver, time can be bought 
        with soft, sweet, simple talk suggesting frailty, division, and hesitation, 
        in order to placate Western suspicions with a flowery show of conciliatory 
        sentiments and some “modernizing” approximation to democratic values. 
        In the threat of danger and in need of restoring the warlike spirit and 
        martial discipline to the foot soldiers, it’s time to abandon all affectation 
        of prudence and stir up fierce threats and shows of force.</p>
      <p>At this moment, this movement is engaged on the most far-reaching and 
        complex operation in its history: reorganize itself on a global scale, 
        moving from a centralized, hierarchical structure based in the USSR, to 
        a flexible, multi-centric organization with diverse sources of financial 
        support, transitioning from the Soviet money-laundering machine into a 
        complex network of independent sources, ranging from respectable multinational 
        companies founded with secret KGB funds to smuggling operations.</p>
      <p>This is not the time for blusters, rather it’s time to play the nice 
        guy, the poor guy, to play dead. The attacks on the World Trade Center 
        and the Pentagon were the rash work of fearless allies, Taliban lunatics. 
        Applauding them ostensibly would be the declaration of a war which the 
        Communist forces are not prepared to fight. Condemning  them “in totum” 
        would be humiliation before the U.S. Therefore the command words, ambiguous 
        and elusive, are emanated from Cuba and obeyed uniformly by leftist militants 
        around the world: vocally condemn the violence of the attacks, but provide 
        moral legitimacy and blame the victims through allegations of “those who 
        reap what they sow.”</p>
      <p>D. Luciana Genro, state representative of the labor party, was one of 
        the many voices that, in the general chorus of leftism, faithfully echoed 
        the message of the master in the Brazilian press, condemning the attack 
        while explaining it as the logical  — and, in the bottom-line, just — 
        reaction of communities pushed to desperation by the oppression of the 
        U.S. empire.</p>
      <p>This rationale is clearly insane. No country is under the occupation 
        of U.S. troops, while places like Lhasa, Tibet, have fewer Tibetans than 
        Communist Chinese soldiers. Afghanistan has never been violated by the 
        U.S., rather by the Soviets who killed a million Afghanis and who abandoned 
        the country only when U.S. support tipped the scales in favor of the Islamic 
        militants. The Iranian revolution never encountered U.S. military opposition, 
        rather it received some secret support in toppling Rez Pahlevi. Finally, 
        during the Gulf War when there was a chance to invade Baghdad and turn 
        Saddam Hussein into atomic dust, the U.S. stopped at freeing Kuwait and 
        left the Iraqi dictator humble but intact, in his little throne of shadows. 
        In general, the economies of the Islamic world would all have gone to 
        hell if not for the U.S. support, and the only thing that Muslims can 
        really object to about Yankee imperialism is that it prevents them from 
        annihilating the Jewish population of Israel, as so many of them would 
        so like to do.</p>
      <p>Comparing one kind of desperation with another, there would be greater 
        reason to smash two Boeings into the Kremlin or the Palace of Celestial 
        Peace rather than the World Trade Center.</p>
      <p>To reveal this to D. Luciana, but in simple, didactic terms, accessible 
        to her recalcitrant neurons of this stubborn pupil who skipped the democracy 
        classes, journalist Diego Casagrande conceived a pedagogical little story 
        in which liberal and conservative gaucho voters, faced with such desperation 
        at the rise of the prepotent Labor Party in their state, beat the representative 
        as well as Father Roque, also a Labor Party representative, who accompanied 
        her in such an inauspicious and hypothetical circumstance.</p>
      <p>In the short example, smaller than a regular paragraph, Casagrande reveals 
        the moral of the story: no matter how great the desperation, nothing can 
        justify such evil acts against two respected individuals or anyone else.</p>
      <p>The message could not be any clearer: if desperation cannot justify the 
        beatings of D. Luciana and Father Roque, it cannot justify smashing planes 
        into buildings.</p>
      <p>Surprisingly, D. Luciana interpreted the story in a different manner 
        and said that Casagrande was inciting people to beat her and Father Roque, 
        before announcing plans to sue the writer.</p>
      <p>I don’t think I could have been any clearer than the writer of this little 
        story. I believe I am a reasonable university professor, but I admit that 
        I have little skill in child pedagogy. So I’ll give up explaining anything 
        to the representative, and limit myself to present to my readers the following 
        dilemma, which troubles me at this difficult moment. The FARC has already 
        killed 30,000 people in its country and, thanks to Fernandinhos Beira-Mar 
        and “tutti quanti”, have gained control of a good share of the Brazilian 
        illicit drug market. I would like to do something about that, to prevent 
        Brazil from becoming the next Colombia. I would like to, but I cannot. 
        Here, the FARC receives official recognition, welcoming from the governor 
        of Rio Grande, and homage from the World Social Forum. Even Fernandinho 
        himself, a dangerous drug dealler, cannot be touched: shortly after being 
        captured, waves of misinformation filled the press, intending to cover 
        up the macabre alliance between the country’s number one bandit and the 
        international revolution.</p>
      <p>Therefore, my hands are tied. I can do nothing. I feel desperate. What 
        do the readers think? If, in this extreme situation, I hijack, I don’t 
        say a Boeing, but maybe a twin-prop Embraer and smash it into the Piratini 
        Palace, would I be morally justified in my desperation? Or better yet: 
        if, in light of my complete lack of piloting skills to such an enterprise, 
        I find something closer at hand and choose to smash my notebook into Dr. 
        Olivio Dutra’s head, could I allege in defense that I merely released 
        the tempest that was created by his official acts?</p>
      <p>And if Diego Casagrande, in trying to dissuade me from such terrorist 
        inclinations, writes a story to show how it would be ugly if Dona Luciana 
        and Father Roque, in despite of their unger, decided to beat me, could 
        I conclude that he induced them to be violent with me?</p>
