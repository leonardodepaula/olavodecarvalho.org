      <p>To deny a victimized country the right to react, force it to submit to 
        the decision and command of foreign organisms over its defense operations, 
        is certainly a more devastating attack on its national sovereignty than 
        would be the destruction of a thousand World Trade Centers.</p>
      <p>In toppling the towers, Osama Bin Laden is accused around the world of 
        a colossal crime. But much more to blame are those who take advantage 
        of the victim’s momentary disorientation to attack on all sides and demand 
        it not only to abdicate its elementary right to self-defense but to abdicate 
        to it on its knees, with humility and contrition, accepting the terrorist 
        attack as a divine sentence, whose superior justice is not minimally affected 
        by the accidental detail of being implemented through criminal means.</p>
      <p>With the smoke barely cleared from the crumbled towers, thousands of 
        voices have raised up in order to turn around the spontaneous indignation 
        at terrorists against the U.S. In unisonous, like a well-disciplined chorus, 
        leftist leaders and intellectuals dedicated themselves to complete in 
        legal, political, and diplomatic arenas, the work Bin Laden started on 
        the battlefield. Yes, what other objective could Bin Laden have had in 
        the September attacks if not to bend the U.S. spine, humiliate and weaken 
        the strongest and most prosperous nation? And how best to reach this objective 
        than by stealing its right to respond and forcing it to weaken itself 
        in an extemporaneous “mea culpa” at the very moment it most needs to concentrate 
        its forces and national pride in defense from its aggressor?</p>
      <p>The logic articulation of the attacks and of the much too artificial 
        wave of anti-American sentiment in the following days is so clear, that 
        all affectation of good sentiments on the part of the supporters of this 
        perverse campaign unmasks itself, right away, as the patent hypocrisy 
        of the greatest and, in fact, only real benefactors of the crime.</p>
      <p>Yes, the only ones. What benefit could Islamic countries reap from Bin 
        Laden’s attacks? Expose themselves to the world as barbaric nations, murderers, 
        fanatics? Welcome the cannons and nuclear warheads of the U.S.? Only if 
        they’re crazier than the most hateful anti-Islamic sentiment could picture 
        them.</p>
      <p>What benefit could Israel expect? Position itself between two fronts 
        in a war of global proportions? Expose New York, London, Paris Jews to 
        the vengeful anger of Muslims who live in these places in greater numbers 
        than they? Unthinkable.</p>
      <p>And what could the U.S. expect to gain, whether with the September attacks 
        or with involvement in a war that could spread and attract the animosity 
        of half the world?</p>
      <p>No, the U.S. has nothing to gain, Israel has nothing to gain, and Islamic 
        countries have nothing to gain.</p>
      <p>The only ones to gain, which by the way is already gaining, is a well 
        defined class of people who are unidentified with any one particular nation 
        but united under a common ideology and strategy. It’s  the International 
        Leftist.</p>
      <p>The indecent speed in which, following the initial shock, the global 
        anti-American propaganda machine entered the scene to unleash a second 
        and more powerful attack on the weakened victim cannot be explained if 
        not by the complete continuity of aims between the first and second attacks, 
        between Bin Laden in the Afghani mountains and the thousands of Bin Ladens 
        in diplomacy and the media.</p>
      <p>To suggest that Bin Laden unleashed his Boeings in pure isolation and 
        singular, anarchic initiative and with no overarching political support, 
        is so childish as not to merit discussion. Even more so when the unity 
        of the motives no longer hides himself, rather, without fearing countermeasures, 
        impundently shows off the similarity in speeches from Kofi Annan to Fidel 
        Castro, passing by an infinitude of helpful Baltazars Garzons.</p>
      <p>I don’t know if these forces armed Bin Laden. But, armed by him, these 
        forces present a much more fearful threat to the U.S. than all the kamikazes 
        and Talibans of a thousand and one nights full of nightmares.</p>
      <p>What is undeniable is that something is learned in the urgency of these 
        events. They destroy in one fell swoop the myth of a uni-polar world. 
        A uni-polar world never existed. The Cold War was simply replaced by a 
        new duel of giants: on one side the U.S., and on the other a multinational 
        collection of powers including the world leftist intelligentsia, international 
        organizations (UN, Unesco, IMF, World Bank), thousands of NGOs, and a 
        handful of financial conglomerates that, even when mostly owned by Americans, 
        have interests far from those of the U.S.  nation and often against them. 
        This collection clearly represents the nucleus of the New World Order, 
        a controlling and socialist force that exists from sucking the vital energy 
        of the U.S., use it in megalomaniacal projects of universal control that 
        restrict U.S. national sovereignty and that of other countries, and finally 
        lay the blame on the U.S.</p>
      <p>I know no more than three or four Brazilians who are aware of the mortal 
        conflict today waging between American interests and those of globalism. 
        Common people and the elite, not only in Brazil but in all other countris 
        of the Third World, are fooled into believing that international organisms, 
        for example, represent branches of American power while they actually 
        choke, subjugate, and weaken this power each day. I know no more than 
        three or four Brazilians who are aware of the desperate protests by U.S. 
        nationalists against global oppression, which represents to us the supreme 
        incarnation of American national ambition.</p>
      <p>The sudden and unified mobilization of spokespeople from this collective 
        in an apparent attack on U.S. national sovereignty serves to show this 
        long hidden conflict to the world. There has never been a uni-polar world. 
        The opposing pole was merely invisible because it had no state identity; 
        its cohesion, camouflaged in plurality of its faces spread all over the 
        world could only be captured in an effort of abstraction, which is difficult 
        to most, repugnant to others. The sudden radicalization resulting from 
        the attacks has forcibly brought forward this unity. Before, anyone could 
        refuse to see it, for fear of opening up old wounds from the Cold War. 
        Now, those wounds have opened again.</p>
