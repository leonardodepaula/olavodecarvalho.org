      <p align=center>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>“We will no longer distinguish between the terrorists and those who harbor 
        them,” said President George W. Bush following the September attacks.</p>
      <p>There are four ways to harbor a terrorist group. There are the states 
        that arm or shelter them, the false organisms that disguise them, the 
        legal or illegal fortunes that subsidize them, and last but not least 
        the “opinion makers” who support their armed aggression through acts of 
        misinformation and psychological warfare.</p>
      <p>The first three forms of collaboration require direct contact with the 
        criminals, but the fourth by definition has a expansive and evanescent 
        nature. A small team may conceive the verbal commands and phony information, 
        but there is no other way the messages can be dispersed  but through a 
        network of informal helpers, wherein the most outlying contributors, seemingly 
        unsuspecting individuals, with no knowledge of the decision makers, merely 
        echo the orders without question what their sources are. From directors 
        to militants, and from militants to “travelling companions,” and on to 
        mere simpletons, the formulas handed down from the commander spread in 
        concentric circles in a controlled, almost quantifiable progression. Organizing 
        and activating this type of operation is a well-developed technique. All 
        totalitarian regimes and parties strive to install training centers for 
        these kind of professionals, especially since the 1930s when Soviet networks 
        of misinformation were established by Karl Radek and grew strongly among 
        Western intellectuals, thanks to the evil genius of Willi Munzenberg.</p>
      <p>Those most directly involved in providing protection for the criminals 
        behind the September attacks are surely far from Brazil, in Asia, Europe, 
        and even the U.S. But the network of misinformation and psychological 
        warfare would not possibly go on without reaching here.</p>
      <p>Before the last brick of the World Trade Center touched the ground, “specialists” 
        and “international analysts,” all notoriously sympathetic or tied to leftist 
        movements, rushed to the television cameras or to the newspapers to:</p>
      <p>1) Soften the horrible impression of a monstrous crime, and legitimize 
        it as the “natural consequence” of the militarism and willfulness of the 
        Bush administration.</p>
      <p>2) Highlight the vulnerability of the U.S., above all, and contrast that 
        with the image of the mighty U.S. economy.</p>
      <p>The first is misinformation, and the second is psychological warfare.</p>
      <p>On one hand, the U.S. has done nothing in the past decade but withdraw 
        its military presence and disarm its forces, reducing stocks of atomic 
        weapons to a fifth of the Russian and Chinese reserves and ceding increasingly 
        larger shares of its sovereignty to the UN. It’s true that George W. Bush 
        is reacting against that. But a complex operation like the September attacks 
        could not have been improvised in the months following his arrival to 
        office. The attack was not a response to Bush’s fervent attitudes, rather 
        it was planned to take advantage of the suicidal complacency of the Clinton 
        administration. And it worked. </p>
      <p>On the other hand, there is no defense system that could possibly prevent 
        the type of terrorist attack that shook New York and Washington. If they 
        happened in the U.S. and not in China, in Cuba or in Iraq, that’s simply 
        because only dictatorial regimes train fanatics for this type of kamikaze 
        operation. Therefore  this case does not expose any special vulnerability. 
        Any praise to this vulnerability is a lie designed to discredit the U.S., 
        painting it as a rich and weak country, in order to transform, in the 
        soul of the peoples, admiration into envy and rancor and fear into aggressive 
        anger.</p>
      <p>These two opinions, broadcast in the Brazilian media with exemplary uniformity, 
        are not interpretations or explanations of an act of war: they are part 
        of it. The individuals behind them do not distinguish, morally or maybe 
        even politically, from the planners and agents of this murderous operation.</p>
