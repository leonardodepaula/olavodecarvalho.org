      <h4>The stronger communism becomes in Brazil, less can we <br>
        talk about it</h4>
      <p>Never have so many and such good books about communism been published 
        in the world as in these years that followed the dismantling of the URSS. 
        The reason is obvious: the opening, even if partial, of the Files of the 
        Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party, a never-ending treasure 
        for the scholars. It is not amazing that, the barrier of state secret 
        being broken, so many investigators throw themselves into these registers 
        of a dark past to decipher what certainly was one of the greatest mysteries 
        of Human History: the voluntary genuflection of millions of cultured men 
        before the altar of a grotesque, assassin and intrinsically absurd doctrine. 
      </p>
      <p>All the paradoxes, all the contradictions of the human soul press and 
        fuse together in the composition of this mystery of iniquity; to understand 
        it so we do not have to relive it is the number one duty of whomever has 
        assimilated Socrates’ lesson, according to which “a life that has not 
        been examined is not worthy of being lived”. </p>
      <p>But the amazing thing is not the international wave of curiosity that 
        turned Moscow into historian’s Mecca. It’s the absolute lack of interest 
        that, in Brazil, opposes itself to the divulging of these discoveries.  
      </p>
      <p>Faster than thought, in the beginning of the nineties, communism was 
        decreed a thing of the past in Brazil. Whoever had any interest in reminding 
        its crimes and atrocities became suspect of Macarthist fanaticism, or 
        even of monomaniac obsession worthy of psychiatric care. To forget, to 
        silence – or rather, at best, dismiss the matter with half a dozen clichés 
        accepted as the definitive explanation – became a natural law to which 
        only the abnormal could escape from. </p>
      <p>But I say that abnormal is a mind capable of judging mere coincidence 
        the fact that this decade of forgetfulness was also the one of greatest 
        expansion of communist influence over the destinies of the country. </p>
      <p>I am not referring only to the electoral growth of the left. I refer 
        to the conquest of the monopoly of political preaching in schools (where 
        today the hypothesis of an anticommunist discourse is today inconceivable) 
        and to the consolidation of certain acquired moral rights that are ostensibly 
        denied to the rest of the population. </p>
      <p>An openly violent communist movement is accepted today as a partner of 
        the State, without the need even of legal registration. Communist politicians 
        can associate to drug-dealing organizations without ever being investigated. 
        Communist groups can block at will the freeways without anyone seeing 
        in this the obvious exercise in insurrection training it is.   </p>
      <p>Ostensibly supported by the government, the communists put themselves 
        above the law and besides that detain the almost complete monopoly of 
        the means to investigate, denounce, judge, and condemn. Even before they 
        nominally occupy governmental power, they already are a special class, 
        an omnipotent, arrogant, and intolerant <i>nomenklatura</i>. As consequence, 
        the simple act of writing some articles against them became an insult, 
        a threat, and an unbearable abuse. </p>
      <p>This is the reason of the lack of interest I referred to. There is a 
        direct connection of cause and effect between the wordless prohibition 
        of looking at the past and the lightning speed with which it repeats itself 
        before millions of ignorant eyes that, not having known it, cannot recognize 
        it. Communism is “out of fashion” as the clothes that move out of the 
        catwalks to enter general daily use. It was simply needed to keep it out 
        of the horizon of national consciousness so that, without being bothered 
        by inquisitive eyes, it could grow on the shadow of the general indifference 
        of its victims.  </p>
      <p>That is exactly why I interpret as opposite the inhibiting counsel that 
        recommend that I speak less of communism to look less crazy or fanatic. 
        Before the great tragedy that prepares itself, only a morbidly intimidated 
        observer would abstain from touching the subject not to give the impression 
        he is seeing things. And, honestly, it is not worth it to let yourself 
        go crazy for mere obsession of looking normal.</p>
