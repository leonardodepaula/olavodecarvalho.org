      <p align=left><b>It’s not hard to understand, if you can access the premises</b></p>
      <p align=left>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>In any terrorist mindset, there is some continuity between preparing 
        the environment, carrying out the attack, and reaping the results. Communist 
        jargon calls such attacks “armed propaganda.” The reason is obvious: the 
        goal is not a specific military achievement, rather the spectacular display 
        of whatever there is to be feared. To this end, agents must act with unarmed 
        propaganda to prepare for, orient, and multiply the impacts.</p>
      <p>The greatest outlay of armed propaganda of all times was cast on the 
        World Trade Center and the Pentagon a few days after the unarmed propaganda 
        show debuted on the other side of the world with the demoralization of 
        Israel and the U.S. by the UN at the Durban Conference. After the towers 
        had fallen, the mobilization to make good use of the results followed: 
        a global campaign, punctuated by Fidel Castro, to single out the victim 
        for the responsibility of the attacks and, the first time in human history, 
        to denie a victimized country the right to react, pressuring it to hand 
        over to the UN the authority to decide its national destiny.</p>
      <p>The ideological identity of the scene directors in both shows, before 
        and after the attacks, is very much the same: the International Leftists, 
        entrenched in the UN and empowered by the exclusion of the U.S. presence 
        in the Human Rights Commission. The primary premise and the conclusion 
        of the syllogism are, therefore, much clear. Uncovering the secondary 
        implicit premise is a simple task, but becomes complicated when so many 
        voices, exploiting the congenial ambiguity of Islamic terrorism, dedicate 
        themselves to underline its religious identity in order to cover up its 
        political identity. Religiously, Bin Laden’s squad is part of one of the 
        last vestiges of religious conservatism in the world. Politically, it 
        sides with the International Leftist. If the political face of terror 
        reveals the unity of armed and unarmed propaganda, by similar reasoning, 
        the religious face distinguishes and separates them, camouflaging the 
        secondary premise. This is why so many people in the press attempt to 
        associate Bin Laden with Islam, which only has to lose with terrorist 
        actions, rather to link him with the leftists, who have only to gain.</p>
      <p>When Bin Laden said there is a plot underlying the war between the West 
        and Islam at the benefit of Israel, he allows one to glimpse the truth 
        in the bottom of all lies. The plot exists, but Israel can expect from 
        this war nothing but its own destruction. As for the U.S. and Islam. The 
        only ones to expect something better are the International Leftist. In 
        fact, they don’t have to wait. Beating with the Islamic hand and, at the 
        same time, pretending to befriend the victim only to manipulate their 
        right to respond, they’re already winning by five times over: they escape 
        the blame of unarmed propaganda, play one side of Judeo-Christian and 
        Muslim conservatives against the other, receive new ammunition for additional 
        press campaigns, win yet another round in its decades old battle to make 
        the UN the global government, and push the debts of its monstrous global 
        ambition on the U.S. account – all this, while staying out of the spotlight 
        except to play guardian of peace. And never has the question <i>Quia bono? 
        </i>(Who benefits from this crime?) been so eloquently answered. Some 
        additional data may make this even clearer. Why hold a conference against 
        racism in a country engaged in ethnic cleansing against a white minority 
        if this exactly this issue were excluded from the schedule of debates? 
        It seems absurd, doesn’t it? But there’s a method to the appearing madness. 
        South Africa, ruled by a Communist party, has tight links to the Taliban 
        and Cuba, headquarters of global terrorism. And according to Anthony LoBaido, 
        one of the experienced correspondents in the country, the Durban elite 
        is infested with Muslim radicals sympathetic to Bin Laden, including the 
        police chief and local delegate of Interpol. The dissemination of unarmed 
        propaganda could not spring from more fertile soil.</p>
