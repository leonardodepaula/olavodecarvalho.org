      <p>If Kant asserts that metaphysical science is impossible for lacking a 
        representable object in intuition, it is because he has not meditated 
        deep enough about the very notion of &quot;ob-ject&quot;. Intuition of 
        any object is intuition of a finite form, whose borders with other objects 
        immediately reveal us the limits of its entire set of possibilities of 
        action and passion (in other words, possibilities of acting or suffering 
        actions). Looking at a cat, we know by means of intuition that it cannot 
        fly. If this information about the cat were absent from in-tuition, than 
        it would be a false intuition, or else, it would be the intuition of a 
        generic cast of a cat which is not a cat. Looking at a square, we instantly 
        know it cannot be divided by one segment of a straight line into two squares, 
        and if cut by an exact diagonal line, there will be two isosceles triangles 
        as a result. To be able to immediately know these facts is to have the 
        intuition of the square. A simple and passive perception of a square shape, 
        regard-less of any of its inherent form properties, is not yet an intuition: 
        it is pure sensation and matter for a possible intuition which will take 
        place at the precise moment when the square begins to show something of 
        its internal constitution. Hence, intuition is not just a senso-rial perception 
        of a static form. Rather, it is the intellection of a finite system of 
        possibili-ties, the grasping - no matter how diffuse and vague it may 
        be at start -, of an algorithmic formula of an organized and unitary set 
        of potencies. A set whose integral form exactly en-folds both identity 
        and unity of the object of intuition. In view of this, that set of potencies 
        is simultaneously intuited in poles apart: positive and negative. Positive, 
        for the assertion of potencies - at least, of some of them - which reveal 
        themselves in the form of the object. Negative, for the limits that distinguish 
        these potencies from other possible or surrounding ones absent from the 
        object itself, exactly as in the case of the cat, which is instantly per-ceived 
        as a walking and not a flying animal. In short: a form is perceived in 
        one instanta-neous and inseparable way as an articulated set of possibilities 
        and impossibilities.</p>
      <p>That very instantaneousness, inherent in the nature of the intuitive 
        act, makes the kant-ian distinction between what is data coming from the 
        object and what is (according to Kant) projected either by a priori structures 
        of our own way of perception or by the catego-ries of our reason onto 
        it, impossible for the matter. These structures, being general and ubiquitous, 
        identical in all men, could not magically adapt themselves to an object's 
        given forms, one by one, if the object in turn did not mold them to itself 
        by force of its intrinsical constitution. To suppose the contrary would 
        be to admit the object is just pure matter without its own formal limits, 
        being its sole limits those projected by the observer onto it. For that 
        reason, there would not be another way to distinguish among the various 
        objects but for the projections made by the subject of understanding, 
        being this subject free to randomly cast onto this or that object any 
        form he so desired. In principle, nothing could prevent a subject from 
        projecting at a cat the form of a triangle or at a triangle the form of 
        a hen. That would make perception simply impossible, as well as any practical 
        adaptation of the observer to the material surroundings circumstances. 
        It is thus mandatory to admit that the limits of the object -- its form, 
        indeed -- are manifested in an evident manner by its mere and simple presence. 
        Well, as we have seen, those limits are an organized system of possibilities 
        and impossi-bilities. Thus, possibility and impossibility - as well as 
        the articulation between both of them - are not forms a priori projected 
        onto an object. They are, in fact, constitutive ele-ments of its very 
        presence. To intuit an object is to instantaneously apprehend in its form 
        a defined articulation of possibilities and impossibilities. 
      <p>But at the same time, neither possibility nor impossibility, and not 
        even their articula-tion, are in themselves objects of sense perception. 
        If they are not pure projected forms, neither are they given to us as 
        objects. They are given &quot;in&quot; an object, but not as objects. 
        The solution to this apparent enigma is that they are indeed the very 
        form of objec-tuality. To be an object - real or imaginary - is to have 
        the power of presenting itself as an articulated system of possibilities 
        and impossibilities, a system condensed in such a way it is instantaneously 
        apprehensible by means of intuition. </p>
      <p>In that sense, Kant was right by saying that metaphysics' &quot;traditional&quot; 
        objects - considering what he regarded as metaphysics, learned from Descartes, 
        Spinoza, Leibniz and Wolff --, i.e., God, liberty, immortality and so 
        on, are not objects of experience. </p>
      <p>However, metaphysics, instead of being the study of any of those particular 
        objects, is the study of possibility and of impossibility as understood 
        from their most comprehensive and universal meaning. The very terms used 
        to describe and write about conventional meta-physical issues -omnipotence, 
        infinitude, absoluteness and so on -- have no meaning at all, except when 
        defined in terms of possibility and impossibility.</p>
      <p>Therefore, possibility and impossibility, not being themselves data coming 
        from experi-ence, are in turn given during experience itself, and no experience 
        happens without them. At the ontological level, by not being objects, 
        they are essential constituents of objectual-ity, as well as of objectivity 
        at the knowledge level. Although they are not themselves ob-jects of intuition, 
        they cannot be disembodied from intuition, because intuition is nothing 
        more than the instantaneous understanding of a given articulation between 
        possibility and impossibility as a definite objective presence.</p>
      <p> Accordingly, there is no obstacle whatsoever to prevent possibility 
        and impossibility from becoming objects of scientific knowledge through 
        the very same methods by which other kinds of constituents become objects 
        of any science, i.e., by the abstractive separation of data taken from 
        an experience. Metaphysics is the science of objectuality as such, that 
        is to say: it is the fundamental of the very possibility of constituting 
        any objective knowledge. There is obviously a spontaneous metaphysical 
        understanding embodied in the act of delimitating an object of any science, 
        and without this understanding, no science would be possible. It would 
        not be possible to delimit objects - either those of science or those 
        of any practical or cognitive activity - without the aptitude of perceiving 
        the forms-limits from the data of an experience. That aptitude is precisely 
        the metaphysical talent inherent in human intelligence as a whole. Man 
        is the only animal that produces science because he is the only metaphysical 
        animal: the only animal capable of objectivity, that is, of understanding 
        objectuality in objects.</p>
      <p>The conceivable argument against those acknowledgments, such as &quot;possibility 
        and im-possibility are mere generic logical frameworks, without any concrete 
        substantiality&quot;, is worthless. Indeed, it is only in concrete substantiality 
        that they appear and their very ap-pearance, as we have seen, is itself 
        concrete substantiality. Or else, it is the only concrete substantiality 
        of objects of experience. Without this concrete substantiality, those 
        objects could not be intuited, i.e., they could not be understood as substantive 
        presences, but solely as empty forms. The very notion of possibility and 
        impossibility, fathomed as pure logical form, external to the reality 
        of an experience, is simply one of the possibilities we instantaneously 
        apprehend during the concrete articulation between possibility and im-possibility, 
        as presented in an experience. From this articulation, we abstractly separate 
        data that makes it real, and keeping in mind the abstract concept of possibility 
        and impos-sibility, we then proceed by separately considering it as a 
        pure being of reason. Such an abstract separation would be obviously impossible 
        if lacking a previous apprehension of any concrete articulation between 
        possibility and impossibility in a given case, thus, relying on it not 
        only logically as well as ontologically, being worthless any artifice 
        such as throw-ing at an experience something that can only be obtained 
        - by means of abstraction - from the very same experience.</p>
      <p> Kant himself, when intending to reduce possibility and impossibility 
        to mere logical cate-gories, independent of experience, has not been able 
        to conceive an experience that were independent of them, which emphasizes 
        the huge difference between a mental distinction and a real-real distinction, 
        as understood by Scholastic philosophers. Possibility and im-possibility 
        can be &quot;independently&quot; conceived, with regards to an experience, 
        precisely be-cause they are the founding conditions of objectuality and 
        transcend any particular experi-ence as well as any particular object. 
        For this same reason, an object -when considered &quot;out&quot; and &quot;independently&quot; 
        of them- is not even pure, amorphous and generic matter. It is just a 
        chimerical conjecture: an object without objectuality.</p>
      <p> Hence, there is no way out. Metaphysics is not only possible but also 
        absolutely neces-sary, at least as a fundamental - implicit and explicit 
        - of the possibility of sciences. </p>
