      <p>Every time the leftist want to impose a new item of their program, they 
        say it is the only way to cure certain maladies. Invariably, when the 
        proposition comes out victorious, the maladies it proposed to eliminate 
        become worse. The normal thing to do would be, in such circumstances, 
        to lay the responsibility of the disaster on the left. But this never 
        happens, for at once the original legitimizing argument disappears of 
        the repertoire, and is substituted by a new system of allegations, which 
        celebrates failure as success or as a historical necessity which could 
        not be avoided. </p>
      <p>No one will understand a thing of the history of the 20th century – nor 
        of this beginning of the 21st – if they do not know this retroactive justification 
        mechanism through which they make the people work for non-declared goals, 
        which would scandalize them if they knew them and that can only be reached 
        through the indirect way of the carrot hanging in front of the ass’ nose.</p>
      <p>Some examples will make this clearer. </p>
      <p>1) When the Communist Party released its program for the destruction 
        of the “bourgeois” family institutions, comsubstantiating what would latter 
        be the “sexual liberation”, its main allegation, elaborated by dr. Wilhelm 
        Reich, was that homosexuality, sado-masochism, fetishism etc. were fruit 
        of the repressive patriarchal education. Eliminated the cause, this deviant 
        conducts would tend to disappear of the social scene. Well, the last residues 
        of patriarchal values were suppressed from western education between the 
        seventies and the eighties, and what did we see right afterwards? The 
        dissemination, on an apocalyptical scale, of the same conducts they promised 
        to eliminate.  Obtained the result, these conducts started to be celebrated 
        as healthy, honorable and meritorious, and all criticism to them is now 
        frowned upon – sometimes even under penalty of law – as an intolerable 
        abuse and attack against human rights. </p>
      <p>2) When the international left started to fight for the legalization 
        of abortion, one of their main arguments was that the great number of 
        abortions was caused by the prohibition, which facilitated the action 
        of charlatans, crooks and all kinds of non-trained individuals. The legalization, 
        it was promised, would force the abortion to be performed in medically 
        acceptable conditions, therefore lowering the number of cases. What was 
        the result? In the first year, the number of abortions in the USA went 
        from 100 thousand to 1 million, and it never stopped going up to this 
        day. At least 30 million babies were already sacrificed, at the same time 
        that the apologists of legalization, instead of admitting the fallacy 
        of their initial argument, celebrate the fact, working to put aside and 
        incriminate any criticism to the new state of things.</p>
      <p>3) When the North-American left invented the policy of quotas and indemnification 
        known as “affirmative action”, they alleged it would diminish crime in 
        the black community. After the new policy was made official, the number 
        of crimes committed by black men against white men arose significantly, 
        according to statistics from the FBI. What did the apostles of this “affirmative 
        action” do then? Did they recognize that to reinforce the feeling of  
        racial identity was to stimulate prejudices and racial conflicts? Nah. 
        They celebrated the raise in hostilities as a progress of democracy.</p>
      <p>4) When – wishing to destroy the North-American tradition that considered 
        education rather a duty of the community, of the churches and of the families 
        than  of the State – the North-American left demanded the  bureaucratization 
        of teaching, one of its prime arguments was that juvenile delinquency 
        could only be controlled with an educational action from the State. With 
        Jimmy Carter, in 1980, the USA had for the first time a Ministry of  Education 
        and uniform teaching programs. Two decades later, the delinquency among 
        children and adolescents is not only growing much more than before, but 
        also adopted as headquarters the public schools, turned today into danger 
        zones, to the point where, in the beginning of the year, the Mayor’s office 
        in New York was privatizing its schools because of the impossibility of 
        controlling the violence inside them. In answer to that, what did the 
        left do? Did it admit failure? No. It fights for the statal  uniformity 
        of teaching in a world level.</p>
      <p>5) In Brazil, the only way of lowering violence in the rural areas, said 
        the leftists, was to give land and money to MST (The Landless Movement). 
        Very well, the land was given – it was the greatest distribution of land 
        in all human history, with lots of money behind it. Violence has not lessened: 
        it increased a lot. Does the left confess its mistake? No. It organizes 
        violence and celebrates it as the conquering of a new historical stage 
        in the fight for  socialism.</p>
      <p>The examples could be multiplied e “ad infinitum” – and notice I deliberately 
        avoided mentioning extreme cases, which happened inside the socialist 
        countries themselves, such as the collectivization of agriculture in URSS, 
        the Great Step Ahead and the Cultural Revolution in China, the Cuban Revolution, 
        etc. keeping to facts that happened in the capitalist world. </p>
      <p>The saving promise transfigures into disaster and followed by the change 
        in legitimizing discourse was, in sum, the constant and essential “modus 
        agendi” of the international left along a century, and we do not see any 
        sign that any leftist mentor has any conscience problems with that. Au 
        contraire, all of them continue to promise the solution of the maladies 
        , at the same time they have ready, in their drawers, the future legitimization 
        of the enlarged maladies. They promise to lower drug consumption through 
        liberalization, to control corruption through  “participative budgeting”, 
        to repress delinquency through the unarming of the civilians or through 
        the Leninist “alternative law”, which incriminates rather the social standing 
        of the defendant than his criminal act. They know perfectly well where 
        this all takes us – but they also know that no one would support them 
        if they announced out loud what they really desire.  </p>
