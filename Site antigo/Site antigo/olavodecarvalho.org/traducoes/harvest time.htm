        </font> <i>O Globo</i> (Rio de Janeiro), September 7, 2002</p>
      <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
      <p>After the downfall of the USSR became an accomplished fact, the Forum 
        of S&atilde;o Paulo has been, since 1990, the most powerful initiative 
        taken to restart the international communist movement and, in Fidel Castro 
        words, &quot;to regain in Latin America what was lost in East Europe&quot;. 
        Summoned by the Cuban dictator and Luiz In&aacute;cio Lula da Silva, the 
        Forum joins the legal Communist (and pro-Communist) parties, engaged in 
        the struggle for cultural and political hegemony within their nations, 
        and armed organizations involved in kidnapping, terrorism and drug traffic. 
        Among the last, the outstanding one is Farc, whose connections with the 
        Brazilian drug market were proven with the arrest of Fernandinho Beira-Mar. 
        There are also double-faced organizations, both legal and illegal, like 
        the Chilean Communist Party, whose armed wing had something to do with 
        the kidnapping of Washington Olivetto.</p>
      <p>Perhaps the readers will at first find strange a meeting in which legally 
        organized parties fraternize with criminal gangs. Actually, this association 
        only repeats the old Leninist rules that recommend the joining of legal 
        and illegal means in the revolutionary struggle. In fact one of the advantages 
        of the international alliance is to allow that the promiscuous mixture 
        of licit and illicit ways, of moralist rhetoric and drug traffic, of beautiful 
        ideals and the brutality of kidnappings, of humanitarian sentimentalism 
        and organized terror- a mix so clear and evident in continental scale, 
        and at meetings of the Forum- that it appears disguised and nebulous when 
        seen from the perspective of each separate nation. Using Argentineans 
        to act in Mexico, Bolivians in Brazil or Brazilians in Chile, the most 
        obvious connections become invisible to the eyes of local public opinion: 
        the legal parties continue above any suspicion, and the simple suggestion 
        of investigating them is rejected as an intolerable offense, when the 
        arrest of criminals shows full proof of the intimate association between 
        organized crime and leftist politics in the continent; identification 
        that becomes still more evident when the arrest of such persons is followed, 
        with magical coincidence, by the quick and effective mobilization, for 
        the criminals, of officials and &quot;decent folk&quot; of the left.</p>
        <p>Since 1990, the Forum of S&atilde;o Paulo has been meeting regularly. 
        The tenth meeting took place in Havana, Cuba, in December, 2001. Mr. Luiz 
        In&aacute;cio Lula da Silva was there. To deny therefore that he is associated 
        politically with the other entities, signatories to the declarations of 
        the Forum, it is to deny the validity of the Brazilian presidential candidate's 
        signature on official documents of international relevance. As wrote Vasconcelo 
        Quadros in the &quot;Isto &Eacute;&quot; of March 2002, &quot;Brazil shelters 
        a secret network of support of international guerrilla organizations employed 
        in kidnappings, bank robberies and drug traffic&quot;. In a country in 
        which any phone call to a swindler is enough to place a politician under 
        police suspicion, a countrywide refusal to investigate a link enshrined 
        in public documents it is, at least, surprising.</p>
        <p>Still more surprising is that, among so many journalistic commentators, 
        policemen, politicians and the military, all them reputed as intelligent, 
        nobody gets-or wants-to establish a logical link between those facts and 
        the declaration of Dr. Leonardo Boff, in &quot;<i>Jornal do Brasil</i>&quot; 
        of August 23, that with the next election &quot;the time for the Brazilian 
        revolution will have arrived. The sowing was already been done. It is 
        harvest time&quot;. Or, when using the word &quot;revolution&quot;, didn't 
        the retired clergyman mean anything of the sort, and that all was innocent 
        hyperbole?</p>
        <p>The massive and obstinate refusal to face with realism this state of affairs 
        can be explained by the fact that he constitutes a dreadful reality, whose 
        vision would be too traumatic for the delicate nerves of a bourgeoisie 
        dandy, terrified to the point of no longer admitting the reality of the 
        evil that terrifies him. Psychologically kidnapped by a nameless Marxism 
        that permeates the air, the dominant class is already ripe to act its 
        role of docile, smiling and helpful victim.</p>
        <p>But, please, don't think that with those remarks I am acting in favor 
        or against any candidate to the Presidency of the Republic. See this: 
        four candidates, with token differences, have the same ideology, and any 
        one of them, when elected, cannot govern without the support of at least 
        one or two of the other three. It is therefore of a single slate election, 
        subdivided into four temporary denominations. Perhaps what Dr. Boff will 
        not say is that the revolution will be inaugurated with the victory of 
        candidate x or y, but with &quot;the election&quot; itself-no matter who 
        wins. From the psychological point of view, at least, that revolution 
        has already begun: the ideological uniformity, once accepted as the normal 
        state of the democratic politics, is enough to virtually outlaw, as &quot;right 
        wing extremism&quot;, any word henceforth said in favor of liberal capitalism, 
        of the USA or of Israel. Who says it receives regular death threats, no 
        longer with the precaution of delivery as anonymous messages: they are 
        to be seen on internet sites and cause no scandal. Dr. Boff is right: 
        Sowing has already been done. It is harvest time. But all this certainly 
        is mere hyperbole. Yes, it would be a scandal to see some malign intention 
        in such innocent words.</p>
