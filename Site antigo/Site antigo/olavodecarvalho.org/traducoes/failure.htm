      <p>The Durban Conference was a farce and a trap. Its failure was the most 
        logical, just, and healthy thing that has happened in international politics 
        in recent years.</p>
      <p>The conference never honestly proposed to fight racism and discrimination, 
        aiming instead to exalt those communities that have the opportunistic 
        support of the world’s left, which, at the same time became accomplice, 
        through a  criminal silence, of the  persecution and violence suffered 
        by politically inconvenient groups.</p>
      <p>I’m not talking about Christian and Buddhist religious groups who face 
        genocide in China and Vietnam and to whom the conference turned a blind 
        eye. The mere decision to host the event in South Africa shows the level 
        of cynicism that is present. There, apartheid never ended, it just changed 
        color. Boer farmers are being beaten by the sticks of paramilitary troops, 
        prodded on by the pro-Communist government of Thabo Mbeki. As of last 
        week, 1,118 had already been killed, without a single voice being raised 
        in the government against this “ethnic cleansing.”</p>
      <p>The Jewish people are obviously innocent of accusations of racism. They 
        are merely paying for their stupidity. How many Jewish scholars over the 
        years have despised the West, which loved and comforted them, and refused 
        to help those who hated them in return, as much between Israel and the 
        West, as Moses and Christ? Now they have a sample of gratitude from those 
        they protected.</p>
      <p>Equally crazy are the Muslims who, in the shared hatred of Israel and 
        the United States, have formed alliances with groups who used to represent 
        bitter enemies as in Russia and China.</p>
      <p>Nothing in this world can justify that the sons and daughters of Abraham, 
        in killing each other for whatever purpose, join forces with the offspring 
        of lies. This sin has already cost Christians dearly and is beginning 
        to do the same to Jewish followers. And it is not me who say that tomorrow 
        it will fall on the Muslims. It is the prophet’s voice. Mohammed said: 
        “If your predecessors [Jews and Christians] fall in a pit of serpents, 
        so too will you.”</p>
      <p>Who can guarantee the Muslims, so enraged with anti-Israel rhetoric today, 
        that a new declaration of the global government will not emerge tomorrow, 
        under the pretext of protecting women or gays, and expose Islam to the 
        world’s mockery, as it does today with Israel, under the pretext of protecting 
        Palestinians?</p>
      <p>All these latent contradictions, muffled under the talking heads of the 
        day, are suddenly brought to the light of conscience in the failure of 
        the Durban Conference.</p>
      <p>The failure is even more memorable for revealing the conflict between 
        globalism and U.S. national interests, which leftist propaganda has managed 
        to cover up by blaming the U.S. for all the evils of the New World Order. 
        As highlighted by Henry Lamb in his column in World Net Daily, “what the 
        international community really wants is to place the United States under 
        the control of an international authority. Such would be the ‘global village,’ 
        with the United Nations serving as village administrator. The U.S. has 
        already given up more sovereignty to the UN than the U.S. Constitution 
        permits.”</p>
      <p>Let this serve as an alert, while there’s still time left, to all Brazilian 
        nationalists “enrages” who, believing they are shaking the globalist machine 
        that oppresses us,.aim for the U.S.  </p>
      <p>P.S. This article was ready when the terrorist attacks occurred on September 
        11. I decided to keep it because it sheds light on the general environment 
        that prepared the ground to the tragedy. The most elucidating point to 
        add is: before the last brick touched the floor, the globalist intelligentsia 
        had already begun pressuring the U.S. not to react, to play nice, and 
        patiently await the decision of the “international community.” It was 
        a psychological war intended to highlight the armed conflict, an effort 
        to take advantage of a dazed victim and encourage further disarmament.</p>
      <p>Back to the topic.</p>
