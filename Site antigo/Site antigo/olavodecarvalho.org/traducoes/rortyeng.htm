      <p align="left">"Philosophy originated in the attempt to escape to a world 
        where nothing would ever change. Plato, founder of this area of culture 
        that today we call ‘philosophy’, supposed that the difference between 
        past and future would be minimal."</p>
      <p align="left">That is the beginning of a whole-page article published 
        by Mr. Richard Rorty in the Brazilian newspaper <i>Folha de S&atilde;o 
        Paulo</i> on March 3<sup>rd</sup>, 1996. When I started working in journalism 
        thirty years ago, a paragraph like that would be unmercifully deleted 
        by the copy desk, who might even leave a brief and not very polite note 
        to its author, more or less in the following terms: <i>"But how, wise 
        guy, how would Plato wish so anxiously to run away to a world of stability 
        without change, if in this very world he already didn’t see great difference 
        between the past and the future?" </i>Nowadays blatant rubbish is published 
        as a high manifestation of philosophic thought, and nobody from the copy 
        desk comes forward to say that it is not acceptable, not even as an attempt 
        at journalism.</p>
      <p align="left">Besides opening his article with evident nonsense, Mr. Rorty 
        still intends to use such nonsense as the basis for conclusions which 
        violate the most elementary historical truth. For he proceeds: "It was 
        only when they started taking history and time seriously that philosophers 
        replaced their former desire to know another world with hopes for the 
        future of this world. The attempt to take time seriously started with 
        Hegel."</p>
      <p align="left">To begin with, it is well known that Plato, as all Greeks, 
        did see much difference between past and future. If the fact of change 
        itself did not seem to be worth of attention to him, he would not have 
        strived to find an unchangeable pattern behind the transitoriness of things. 
        Second, the concern with "the future of this world" was one of the main 
        concerns of the Platonic endeavor, which was rahter the work of a social 
        and political reformer than that of a pure theoretical contemplator.</p>
      <p align="left">Third, to date from Hegel the beginning of the concern with 
        History and time is to skip over two millenia of Christianity, a religion 
        which differentiated itself from the Greek world view exactly for its 
        emphasis on the temporal and historic character of human life, what is 
        already very clear in St. Augustine.</p>
      <p align="left">Fourth. Why assume there is a contradiction between the 
        concern with History and the will for eternity, when it is exactly the 
        indissoluble union of these two issues that constitutes the basic inspiration 
        for Hegel himself?</p>
      <p align="left">Fifth. When Mr. Rorty interprets the will for eternity as 
        an "evasion" or a "flight", he is just playing upon words and his pun 
        can easily be undone. The impulse to revolutionize the world, to accelerate 
        historical change, with the same verisimilitude, can also be interpreted 
        as a hubris, an alienating agitation, an escape valve in the presence 
        of permanent and inevitable realities, such as death, frailness, ignorance 
        of our ultimate fate, etc. These pejorative interpretations have only 
        a rethorical value, if that much. Taking them for granted and presenting 
        them as unquestionable is not honest at all.</p>
      <p align="left">Based on all these premises, Mr. Rorty finishes the overture 
        of his article with the assertion that the joint influence of Hegel and 
        Darwin <i>distanced philosophy from the question `What are we` and turned 
        it into `What can we become´</i>. This rather pompous historical generalization 
        omits from the reader the information that for Hegel both questions were 
        exactly the same (<i>Wesen ist was gewesen ist</i>). Thereby, far from 
        distancing himself from Greek thought, the philosopher from Jena was just 
        providing a logical development to the Aristotelian doctrine of entelechy, 
        according to which essence is not the static form of a being in a given 
        moment in time, but the goal implicit in its development. Furthermore, 
        it omitts the information that Darwin, on his turn, never said a word 
        about 'What are we' nor about 'What can we become', but was only interested 
        in 'What we were'. Rorty therefore mistakes the theory of evolution for 
        the evolutionist ideology, which is Spencer’s work and not Darwin’s.</p>
      <p align="left">There are so many implied absurdities in a single paragraph 
        that perhaps it is the compressive strength of falsity being rapidly injected 
        in his brains what makes the reader dizzy, incapable of realizing that 
        he is in front of a cheap fraud, disguised as philosophy as a result of 
        pure marketing.</p>
      <p align="left">But I do not believe that Mr. Rorty writes this way for 
        mere incompetence. He knows that he lies – and the secret of the awe he 
        arises in hordes of pedantic youngsters consists precisely in the fact 
        that they envy the power of lying well, for they disbelieve in all truth. 
        There are many who dream about being Richard Rorty when they grow up.</p>
      <p align="left">But do you really want to know who this fellow is? Do you 
        wish to get an idea of how ridiculous it is to honor him as a great philosopher? 
        Going a bit further than what he said in <i>Folha de S&atilde;o Paulo</i>, 
        let us then follow this brief examination of his more general conceptions.</p>
      <p align="left">"Language is not an image of what is real", assures us Mr. 
        Rorty, pragmatistic and anti-Platonic philosopher. Should we interpret 
        this sentence in the sense that Mr. Rorty calls "Platonic", that is, as 
        a denial of an attribute to a substance? It would be contradictory: a 
        language that is not an image of what is real cannot give us a real image 
        of its relations with what is real. So the sentence must be interpreted 
        in the pragmatistic sense: it says nothing about what language is, but 
        only highlights the intention of using it in a certain way. The main thesis 
        of Mr. Rorty’s thought is a statement of intention. "Language is not an 
        image of what is real" means exactly this and nothing else: "I, Richard 
        Rorty, am firmly decided not to use language as an image of what is real". 
        It is an "irrefutable" thesis, as it is not possible to invalidate logically 
        an expression of will. Therefore, there is nothing open for debate: within 
        the limits of decency and of the Penal Code, Mr. Rorty has the right to 
        use language as he wishes.</p>
      <p align="left">The problem comes up when he begins to try to induce us 
        to use language exactly as he does. He says that language <i>is not</i> 
        a representation of reality, <i>but rather</i> a set of tools invented 
        by man to fulfill his wishes. But it is a false alternative. A man may 
        well <i>wish</i> to use this tool to represent reality. It seems that 
        this was exactly what Plato wished. But Mr. Rorty denies that men may 
        have any other wishes rather than seeking pleasure and fleeing pain. That 
        some men do say that they wish something else must be very painful to 
        him. If it were not, there would be no valid pragmatistic explanation 
        for the effort he makes to switch the tone of the conversation. Facing 
        the impossibility of denying that those people do exist, the pragmatist 
        may perhaps say that those who seek to represent reality are moved by 
        the wish to flee pain as much as those who prefer to make up fantasies. 
        But this objection will only come to prove, precisely, that we are not 
        dealing with things that exclude each other. The Rortyan alternative is 
        false in its own terms.</p>
      <p align="left">Confronting this painful realization, Mr. Rorty alleges 
        his philosophy consists in introducing a new vocabulary, one in which 
        all distinctions between absolute and relative, appearance and reality, 
        natural and artificial, true and false will be abolished. He recognizes 
        he does not have a single argument to offer as a defense of such proposal. 
        As it "cannot be expressed in Platonic terminology", it is above, or below, 
        the possibility of being proved or refuted. And he concludes on behalf 
        of all pragmatists: – "That is why our<i> efforts at persuading assume 
        the form of a gradual inculcation of new ways of speaking"</i>. Mr. Rorty, 
        therefore, does not intend to convince us of the truthfulness of his thesis: 
        he only intends to "gradually inculcate us" with his way of speaking. 
        Once it is adopted, we will gradually forget to ask if what we speak is 
        true or false. But gradually inculcating others with a linguistic habit, 
        while also placing it beyond the reach of all rational mediation, is sheer 
        psychological manipulation. We leave therefore the ground of philosophical 
        discussion – that rortyism refuses as "Platonic" – to enter the subtle 
        ground of the imposition of a will by the repetition of slogans and by 
        change in vocabulary. That is what George Orwell called <i>Newspeak</i> 
        in his <i>1984.</i> </p>
      <p align="left">This is perhaps the deep and secret reason why – after having 
        declared that men are but pleasure-seeking beasts and after having reduced 
        language to an instrument that stronger beasts use to dominate weaker 
        beasts – Mr. Rorty can still proclaim that "we, the pragmatists, do not 
        behave as animals", when his discourse seemed to indicate precisely the 
        opposite. Actually, they are really animal <i>trainers</i>. A horse-trainer 
        does not argue with horses, he just uses psychological influence to "gradually 
        inculcate" them with the desired habits.</p>
      <p align="left">Like all animal trainers, pragmatists are moved by pious 
        intentions: "What matters to us is inventing means to diminish human suffering". 
        It is for that noble purpose that Mr. Rorty proposes to abolish the oppositions 
        between true and false, real and apparent, absolute and relative, etc., 
        which make the philosophy students suffer so much, and suggests the universal 
        adoption of the <i>Newspeak</i>. Once adopted this proposal, philosophical 
        debates will not anymore be an uncomfortable clash of arguments and proofs 
        like they used to be, but rather an effort to make the gradual inculcation 
        of new habits in the mind of the audience ever more painless and pleasurable. 
        The new theories will not look for help in the heavy weaponry of logic, 
        but in the delicate tools of marketing, with free samples being given 
        away to newcomers and smiley <i>Playboy</i> bunnies adorning the covers 
        of academic dissertations.</p>
      <p align="left">But the decisive contribution of Mr. Rorty to the relief 
        of human suffering is the combat he wages against the idea that life may 
        have a meaning. It is understandable that Mr. Rorty must feel pretty bad 
        in a universe that makes sense – the odd man out, exactly the way a non-pragmatist 
        would feel in a world devoid of any meaning. Yet, Mr. Rorty does not see 
        the least advantage in arguing with those who do not feel as he does. 
        The controversy between the existence and inexistence of an immanent meaning 
        in the cosmos, he says, "is too radical to be able to be judged from a 
        neutral viewpoint." There is no way to argue: all a man can do is express 
        his will. So again Mr. Rorty’s thesis is a declaration of intention: he, 
        Richard Rorty, will do everything he can so that life will not have any 
        meaning whatsoever. And he does that with extreme competence and dedication. 
        There are those who think that the lack of meaning in life is what makes 
        human beings unhappy<a href="#nota1" class="nota"><sup>1</sup></a><a name="1"></a>, 
        But Mr. Rorty does not care at all. He supports democratic pluralism, 
        the free expression of all points of view. But the confrontation of points 
        of view, as it cannot be settled by any intellectually valid means, becomes 
        just a competition between wills, one whose outcome will be determined 
        by the pure manipulating ability of the winning party </p>
      <p align="left">Those who know Mr. Rorty personally assure us that he is 
        a very nice guy. I believe them. But I doubt he wags his tail. After all, 
        he is not the animal in the story<a href="#nota2"><span class="nota"><sup>2</sup></span></a><a name="2"></a>.</p>

      <div align="left"> 
        <ol>
          <li><b><a name="nota1"></a>Viktor Frankl, for example, the not sufficiently 
            praised Jewish psychiatrist who, in the hell of concentration camps, 
            discovered that a meaning for life is more necessary to man than freedom 
            itself. Frankl told an American audience: "It was not only a handful 
            of ministries in Berlin that invented the gas chambers of Maidanek, 
            Auschwitz, Treblinka, they were prepared in the offices and classrooms 
            of nihilistic scientists and philosophers, among which there were 
            and there are some Nobel-laureate Anglo-Saxon thinkers. If human life 
            is nothing more than an insignificant accidental product of some protein 
            molecules, it does not matter that a psychopath be eliminated as useless 
            and that many other inferior people share his fate: all this is but 
            logic and consequent reasoning" (Viktor Frankl, <i>Man’s Search for 
            Meaning</i>). </b><a href="#1">Back</a></li>
          <li><b><a name="nota2"></a>While reviewing the proofs of this chapter, 
            it occurs to me to remind the reader that a proposal such as Mr. Rorty’s 
            contains in itself, along with the refusal of rational proof, a whole 
            army of antibodies against any attempt to refute it in the serenity 
            of an academic discussion. A "gradual inculcation" never clashes directly 
            with arguments, but takes advantage of the moments when its interlocutor 
            is distracted to surreptitiously induce him to change his state of 
            mind. Its <i>modus argumentandi</i> is not the philosopher’s, nor 
            even the rhetorician’s, but that of the neuro-linguistic programmer. 
            It works beneath the threshold of conscience, after having induced 
            its victim to relax its defenses through mild conversation. Against 
            this kind of actuation the only possible defense is to confront the 
            seducer in the ground he has chosen, i.e., that of psychological action. 
            Therefore, it is not a question of arguing, but of unmasking, just 
            like in psychoanalysis. During Mr. Rorty’s visit to Brazil, I was 
            dumbfounded by the incapacity of his audience to notice the difference 
            between argumentation and seduction. If Mr. Rorty himself admits that 
            there is no use in arguing, what could his apparent arguments be if 
            not a diversion, a <i>trompe l’oeil</i> to keep the conscious attention 
            busy while –away from all critical surveillance – the gradual-inculcator 
            discreetly manipulates the bottom of the soul of the distracted interlocutor? 
            But what silly girl would be foolish enough to try to get rid of a 
            seducer by using polite requests that would only prolong the conversation? 
            In order to expel the seducer it is necessary to deny him any hint 
            of nicety right away and for good. Nowadays there are many currents 
            of opinion that prefer psychological influence to logic reasoning. 
            They do not try to win our agreement, but rather to monopolize our 
            attention. By prolonging a conversation that they themselves recognize 
            is not able to reach any intellectually valid results, they gradually 
            surround us with their atmosphere. They do in such a way that, even 
            if we never explicitly agreed with them, suddenly we are speaking 
            their language, thinking according to their categories, judging according 
            to their values, acting according to their rules. That is how they 
            win our most complete obedience in spite of our superficial disagreement. 
            There is no way to confront them except for open manifestations of 
            antipathy in order to make them understand that what separates us 
            from them is not mere intellectual disagreement, but also a categorical 
            moral rejection. In short: <i>we don’t like their conversation</i>. 
            The tone of this book has therefore a prophylactic sense. </b><a href="#2">Back</a></li>
