      <p align="center">It is not hard to understand it once you uncover its premises</p>
      <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center">By Olavo de Carvalho<br>
        <font size="-1">&#147;&Eacute;poca&#148; (S&atilde;o Paulo, Brazil), Oct 
        6th 2001</font></p>

      <p> In every terrorist plan that is worth its name there is a continuity 
        between the advance preparation of the atmosphere, the attack itself, 
        and then the taking advantage from its effects. Communist jargon calls 
        such attacks &quot;armed propaganda&quot;. The reason is obvious: their 
        goal is not as much a specific military result as the spectacular ostentation 
        of fear. In order to achieve this goal, the attacks must articulate themselves 
        with unarmed propaganda, which anticipates, guides and multiplies its 
        effects.</p>
      <p> The biggest discharge of armed propaganda of all times has been flung 
        against the WTC and the Pentagon a few days after the premi&egrave;re, 
        in the other side of the planet, of the unarmed propaganda show promoted 
        by the United Nations, at the Conference of Durban, to demoralize Israel 
        and the United States. Once the towers had fallen, it was time to start 
        taking advantage from it. So a worldwide campaign was set up, with Fidel 
        Castro on board, to cast upon the victim the responsibility for the attacks 
        and to deny -- for the first time in human history -- the right of an 
        attacked country to react, by pressing it to relinquish to the UN the 
        authority to decide about its own national destiny.</p>
      <p> The ideological identity of scene directors in both shows, in the one 
        preceding the attack and in the one that followed it, is exactly the same: 
        the international left, entrenched in the UN and strengthened by the exclusion 
        of the U.S. of the Human Rights Committee. Thus, the major premise and 
        the conclusion of the syllogism are very clear. Bringing to light the 
        implicit minor premise is an easy task, but one that becomes difficult 
        when so many voices, exploiting the inherent ambiguity of Islamic terrorism, 
        strive to stress its religious identity in order to cover up its political 
        one. From a religious point of view, bin Laden&#146;s group belongs to 
        one of the last bulwarks of religious conservatism in the world. Politically, 
        it teams up with the international left. If the political face of terror 
        reveals the unity between armed and unarmed propaganda, completing the 
        syllogism, its religious face differentiates and separates them, disguising 
        the minor premise. That is why so many people in the media rather try 
        to associate bin Laden to Islam, which has nothing to gain from its terrorist 
        actions, than to the world left, which has everything to gain from those 
        actions.</p>
      <p> When bin Laden says that there is a plot to initiate a war between the 
        West and Islam in order to benefit Israel, he lets the truth be seen at 
        the bottom of his lie. The plot does exist, but from such a war Israel 
        could not expect anything but its own destruction. The same goes to the 
        U.S. and to Islam. The only one who stand to benefit is the international 
        left, and it does not even have to wait to reap its profits. By hitting 
        with an Islamic hand and by pretending to be a friend of the victim in 
        order to usurp its right to react, it is already winning fivefold: it 
        shuns its guilt from unarmed propaganda; it throws one against the other 
        the Jewish-Christian and Muslim religious conservatisms; it gains ammunition 
        for new media campaigns; it wins another round in its five-decade fight 
        to give the UN the status of world government, and still writes on the 
        U.S. account the debts for its monstrous global ambitions -- all this 
        without the need for showing itself upon the stage except in the role 
        of guardian of peace. Never before the question &quot;Quia bono?&quot; 
        (&quot;Who stands to gain from the crime?&quot;) had such an eloquent 
        answer.</p>
      <p> Some additional data might contribute to make it even clearer. Why organize 
        a Conference against Racism in a country which is undergoing &quot;ethnic 
        cleansing&quot; against the white minority, if this very item was excluded 
        from the agenda? Sounds absurd, doesn&#146;t it? But there is a method 
        in apparent absurdity. South Africa, governed by a communist party, has 
        very close connections to the Taliban and to Cuba, headquarters of world 
        terrorism. And according to Anthony LoBaido -- one of most experienced 
        foreign correspondents in the country --, Durban&#146;s elite is infested 
        with Muslim radicals who sympathize with bin Laden, among which the chief 
        of police and the local Interpol agent. The outflow of unarmed propaganda 
        could not have sprung from a more fertile ground.</p>
