        he were President of Brazil,<br>
        he would tranquilize the investors</font></em><font color="#000099" size="2" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Translated by Pedro Sette C&acirc;mara</font></p>
      <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000099" size="2" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Judging 
        by the either alarming or tranquilizing diagnostics published in our press, 
        the only things really threatened by an eventual rise of the radical left 
        are foreign money invested here and Brazil&#8217;s credit in foreign banks. 
        The whole discussion revolves around whether Mr. John Doe or Mr. John 
        Dude, if elected, can or cannot put these supreme goods at risk. In the 
        first hypothesis, he is a dangerous communist; in the second, a champion 
        of democracy.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000099" size="2" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">However, 
        when Lenin destroyed Russian constitutional order in three weeks and established 
        the reign of terror, the stock market in Moscow and Petrograde did not 
        drop a single point, and in the following years foreign investors made 
        a huge amount of money with the new regime. Therefore, according to Brazilian 
        criteria, there is no way Lenin could be a communist.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000099" size="2" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
        preponderance of this stupid criterion reveals only how Brazilian businessmen 
        are blinded by the canons of that diffuse Marxism which induces them to 
        perform in the theatre of reality the exact stereotypical role reserved 
        to them by communist strategy: that of self-seeking immediatists who can 
        be manipulated through their own interests.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000099" size="2" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">That&#8217;s 
        hegemony is: to frame the opponents&#8217; speech, leading them to formulate 
        their thoughts and wishes according a set of mental categories designed 
        to tie them with their own rope.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000099" size="2" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Brazil&#8217;s 
        left may be stupid and incompetent, but, when compared to our businessmen, 
        is a stellar team of geniuses. To anyone versed in Antonio Gramsci&#8217;s 
        strategies, to deceive Brazilian businessmen, making them work for their 
        own destruction, is like spanking children. What can the gross pragmatism 
        of those who measure the world by the money in the register do against 
        the complex machiavelism of the &#8216;cultural revolution&#8217;? It&#8217;s 
        so coward. I know only businessmen who like to give grand displays of 
        tranquility before the advance of communism, and who, in the face of a 
        leftist intellectual, prostrate themselves in servile adoration. It&#8217;s 
        understandable: no matter how much money you possess, intellectual superiority, 
        however small, exerts intrinsic authority and power. In revolutionary 
        strategy, cultural hegemony is the equivalent of that which, in war, is 
        the dominion of air space. Running to hide their treasures, the prey disclose 
        themselves to the eagle who, from above, controls their movements.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000099" size="2" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">That 
        is why instead of losing oneself in vain economicist conjectures, none 
        of them asks the following questions to the presidential candidates:</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000099" size="2" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">1. 
        What is your geopolitical view of the world? Do you intend to use a speech 
        against &#8220;unipolar power&#8221; to align Brazil with the Eastern 
        and communist pole, which existence and growth hides behind that rethoric?</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000099" size="2" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">2. 
        After years of dismantlement and constraint of the armed forces, do you 
        intend to complete dialectically the application of the Leninist scheme, 
        offering the humiliated officials some sort of late consolation in exchance 
        for an anti-Western and pro-communist foreign policy which none of them 
        would have accepted before?</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000099" size="2" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">3. 
        How will you fight against drug traffic without confronting Cuba, the 
        Farc and the world&#8217;s leftist media? Or, on the contrary, will you 
        just stage a fake combat just to terminate the rival cartels &#8211; which 
        dominate the state of Esp&iacute;rito Santo, for example &#8211; and hand 
        to communist narcoguerilla the absolute control of the Brazilian market?</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000099" size="2" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">These 
        are the only important questions. Lenin himself, should he be president 
        of Brazil now, would not even consider the idea of socializing the economy. 
        He would concentrate on the consolidation of capitalism and on tranquilizing 
        the investors, in order to buy time to fight in these three fronts, which 
        are vital to the communist world strategy. Tranquilized by the guarantees 
        offered to their money, the bourgeois would be the first to lend a hand</font>.</p>
