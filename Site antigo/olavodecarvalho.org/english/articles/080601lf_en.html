            <p>In his book <em>America and the World Revolution</em> (Oxford University 

              Press 1962), a transcript of conferences given at the University 

              of Pennsylvania in the spring of 1961, Arnold Toynbee wrote:

            <p>&#8220;<em>If we wish to avoid massive suicide, we have to have 

              our world State as quickly as possible, and this probably means 

              we will need to install it in a non-democratic form to begin with</em>.&#8221; 

            </p>

            <p>This was not a prophecy, it was a proposal. Or rather, it was a 

              reaffirmation of a proposal that had already been under development 

              in the upper echelons of the Anglo-American establishment at least 

              since 1928, when Herbert George Wells published the first popular 

              version of the plan, under the highly suggestive title <a href="http://www.inlex.org/stories/wells/opencons.html"><em>The 

              Open Conspiracy</em></a>. Some historians trace the project back 

              to the end of the 19 th century and list its presence as one of 

              the causes of World War I, but we need not go back that far. The 

              best studies on the life and work of Wells (W. Warren Wagar,<em> 

              H. G. Wells and the World State</em>, Yale University press, 1961; 

              Michael Foot, <em>H. G.: The History of Mr. Wells</em>, Washington, 

              DC, Counterpoint, 1995) leave no doubts as to the role played by 

              the author of <em>The War of the Worlds</em> in the transformation 

              of a general idea into a viable political project. Like Wells, Toynbee 

              was not only an intellectual but also an activist, an intimate collaborator 

              of the British government and globalist circles. His monumental 

              work, <em>A Study of History</em> (1939-1961), provides a unified 

              vision of world historical development indispensable for preparing 

              the ground for the advent of world government.</p>

            <p>The most recent state of implementation of the plan drawn up by 

              these visionaries can be appreciated from the following paragraphs 

              published in the <a href="http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2006/02/21/2003294021">Taipei 

              Times</a> of February 2006, to which no Brazilian political commentator 

              paid much attention, even though their author was no less than Richard 

              Haass, president of the CFR (Council on Foreign Relations), the 

              most powerful think tank in the United States and practically an 

              antechamber of the US presidency:</p>

            <p>&#8220;In the age of globalization, states should give up some 

              sovereignty to world bodies in order to protect their own interests.</p>

            <p>Some governments are prepared to give up elements of sovereignty 

              to address the threat of global climate change. Under one such arrangement, 

              the Kyoto Protocol, which runs through 2012, signatories agree to 

              cap specific emissions. What is needed now is a successor arrangement 

              in which a larger number of governments, including the US, China, 

              and India, accept emissions limits or adopt common standards because 

              they recognize that they would be worse off if no country did.</p>

            <p>Globalization thus implies that sovereignty is not only becoming 

              weaker in reality, but that it needs to become weaker&#8230;. Sovereignty 

              is no longer a sanctuary.&#8221;</p>

            <p>Observations:</p>

            <p> 1. The success of appealing to examples of commerce and &#8220;global 

              climate change&#8221; shows that the world State plan can, on the 

              one hand, be legitimized as a unified response to problems of an 

              international scale and, on the other hand, in itself supports an 

              alarmist trend regarding nonexistent problems in order to legitimize 

              itself by false and fraudulent means. In 2006 the slogan &#8220;global 

              warming&#8221; still might have looked like a friendly warning. 

              Two years later, not only do thousands of scientists openly contest 

              this dogma, but even school children are capable of debunking the 

              legend foisted on the world by the billionaire campaign in which 

              ex-vice President Al Gore serves as the poster boy (see <a href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&pageId=62598">Al 

              Gore's global warming debunked - by kids!</a>).</p>

            <p>2. The procedures used to impose global list reforms bypass normal 

              democratic channels via decisions made in secret sci-tech and administrative 

              commissions whose activity can hardly be understood by the public 

              (see <a href="http://www.olavodecarvalho.org/semana/030524globo.htm">Golpe 

              de estado no mundo</a>). The speed of the changes makes it impossible 

              for the ordinary citizen to make sense of the events. &#8220;Public 

              opinion,&#8221; which, generally speaking, is now little more than 

              a set of vague impressions with little connection to reality, then 

              becomes a mere tool for instituting changes that it will never be 

              able to understand or influence. Toynbee's program emerges, quite 

              plainly implemented: the world State does not suppress democracy, 

              it engulfs it. Democracy continues to exist, but as an organ in 

              a larger body that embraces and controls it without its being in 

              the least aware of this.<br>

              <br>

              3. If other facts that I have cited in my articles have not abundantly 

              proven it, the case of the Kyoto accord will suffice to show an 

              obvious fact that many Brazilian nationalists refuse to understand, 

              namely, that the control centers of globalist power are not found 

              in the American government, nor do the interests of the global State 

              identify in the least with those of good old &#8220;Yankee imperialism.&#8221; 

              From California to New England, from Florida to Oregon, no one is 

              unaware that submitting to the extension of the Kyoto accord implies 

              destruction of the American economic base, reducing the United States 

              to the status of a second-class power. Nor is it lost on the general 

              public that other globalist projects proposed by the CFR, such as 

              the Treaty of the Law of the Sea, or the dissolution of the borders 

              with Mexico or Canada, would complete this destruction and close 

              the chapter of the American nation in history. Curiously, the most 

              lucid left-wing intellectual in the world, Antonio Negri, has explained 

              and repeated a thousand times that the &#8220;Empire&#8221; and 

              &#8220;United States&#8221; are not one and the same thing, that 

              the global empire that is taking shape is supranational not only 

              in its objectives but also in its only internal constitution (not 

              that Negri was the first to discover anything. With minor differences, 

              the essence of his concept of the Empire, published in 2000 by the 

              Harvard University Press under the title Empire, was already all 

              in my book <em>O Jardim das Afli&ccedil;&otilde;es</em> [The Garden 

              of Afflictions], of 1996). But the fact that not even the word of 

              a renowned leftist suffices to unravel the confusion of globalism 

              and Americanism shows in itself that much of Brazilian nationalism 

              is only a form of morbid atavism rather than intelligent patriotism. 

              The everyday discourse of politics reflects this. Indeed, while 

              the only empire that exists in the world is the one referred to 

              by Negri, in Brazil, the term &#8220;empire&#8221; is used as a 

              synonym with &#8220;United States,&#8221; taking its cue from Fidel 

              Castro's communist rhetoric (see &#8220;<a href="http://www.granma.cu/espanol/2008/abril/vier25/reflexiones25.html">Nuestro 

              espiritu de sarificio y el chantaje del Imperio</a>,&#8221; of April 

              25). Thus, the great true Empire, with the Latin American left as 

              one of its chief instruments, is spared public hostility, which 

              is turned specifically against the one nation that, ironically - 

              but not coincidentally - is precisely the one offering the greatest 

              obstacles to Imperial designs.</p>

            <p>4. The globalist scheme fostered by the CFR is not the only one 

              out there. There is a Sino-Russian globalism consolidated under 

              the <a href="http://www.spacewar.com/reports/Shanghai_Pact_Struts_World_Stage.html">Shanghai 

              Pact</a>, which operates essentially by two routes: the financing 

              of terrorism and the control of entire nations by means of the most 

              formidable corruption machine that has ever existed in the world. 

              And then there is an Islamic globalism, which expands by immigration, 

              which is used as a weapon of cultural warfare, in a highly efficient 

              strategy of occupation from within. The relationships between these 

              three schemes of control are extremely intricate and subtle. The 

              Shanghai Pact, for example, is ostensibly a reaction of the left 

              to &#8220;imperialist globalism,&#8221; but in reality, does not 

              oppose it in any way, opposing only the United States, and thereby 

              helping globalism undermine American resistance (the faulty Brazilian 

              language pattern mentioned above is a local example of this phenomenon). 

              The Islamic and Sino-Russian schemes can be seen, to some extent, 

              as competing with each other, but here as well, a web of caveats 

              and ambiguities renders any schematic simplification prohibitive.</p>

            <p> 5. No country can &#8220;confront&#8221; oppressive globalism, 

              but each one has the obligation to integrate itself into it as beneficially 

              as possible for its own people, without in any way compromising 

              its vital interests. However, this calls for a highly trained intellectual 

              elite capable of navigating the twists and turns of the most advanced 

              and complex historic change of all time. In Brazil, this elite does 

              not exist at all, and the assumption that our institutions of &#8220;higher&#8221; 

              learning can provide it is so ridiculous it does not merit discussion. 

              The courses that have not been reduced to the level of training 

              centers for militants are dominated by the most rudimentary of economic 

              pragmatism, or by academic formalism that can only reason in terms 

              of institutions and doctrines without ever getting down to basic 

              issues. As far as I know, the only Brazilian concerned about training 

              this elite is yours truly, but as you know, I can only work on a 

              very small scale in proportion to my resources, or rather, to the 

              lack thereof. Brazil seems doomed to go through this perilous time 

              without understanding where it is headed or who is leading it.</p>
