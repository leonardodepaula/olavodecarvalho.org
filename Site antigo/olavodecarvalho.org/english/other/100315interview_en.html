<p>Olavo de Carvalho, an author and philosopher, is renowned as one 
              of Brazil&#8217;s preeminent thinkers. He played a leading role 
              in exposing subversive leftist organizations like the Foro de S&atilde;o 
              Paulo in his work as a writer for some of Brazil&#8217;s most influential 
              publications. In the course of writing an article about the socialist 
              resurgence in Latin America, I interviewed Carvalho for The New 
              American magazine.</p>
            <p><strong>The New American: </strong><em>Could you please tell me 
              a little bit about yourself, your background, your work, your philosophy, 
              and what motivated you to become involved in exposing the Foro de 
              S&atilde;o Paulo?</em></p>
            <p><strong>Olavo de Carvalho:</strong> Notwithstanding having been 
              a leftist militant as a teenager, I lost any interest in politics 
              after severing my ties with the Left when I was 20 years old in 
              1969. From that time on, until I was 38, I worked as a text editor 
              for newspapers and magazines and dedicated my free time to the study 
              of philosophy, literature, cultural history, ancient esoteric traditions, 
              and comparative religion. Though I delivered an occasional lecture 
              here and there, I was happy to live as an anonymous scholar, perfectly 
              unknown to public opinion and academic circles. It was only in the 
              late &#8217;80s that my attention was drawn to the ongoing destruction 
              of high culture in Brazil, and I started to take notes on the alarming 
              stupidities that were published in ever growing quantities by very 
              influential Brazilian opinion makers, both academic and journalistic. 
              Bit by bit I grasped the political factors that had generated that 
              state of affairs, and in 1993 I wrote a book, <em>The New Age and 
              the Cultural Revolution</em>, about the overtaking of higher education 
              by the communist militancy, which was not at all interested in high 
              culture, but only in gaining political power and profiting from 
              the general dumbing down of Brazilian students. In 1995 I wrote 
              <em>The Garden of Afflictions</em>, a study on the evolution of 
              the idea of &#8220;Empire&#8221; in the West, since the times of 
              Julius Caesar to the advent of the New World Order.... The following 
              year I collected my notes about Brazilian cultural decay and published 
              them under the title of <em>The Collective Imbecile</em>, ... leading 
              some big newspapers to hire me as a weekly political columnist.... 
              Meanwhile, I had founded an electronic newspaper, <em>M&iacute;dia 
              Sem M&aacute;scara</em> (&#8220;Unmasked Media&#8221;), that intended 
              to correct the most flagrant distortions of the news published by 
              the big media.... In 2005, as I was getting tired of receiving weekly 
              death threats from leftist maniacs, I found it was a good idea to 
              accept a job as a Washington foreign correspondent that was offered 
              to me by a traditional Brazilian business newspaper, the <em>Di&aacute;rio 
              do Com&eacute;rcio</em> (&#8220;Business Daily&#8221;), and here 
              I am living in Virginia with my family. I love to be here, because 
              Americans, though already infected by the neo-communist virus, are 
              not yet so stupid as Brazilians have become.</p>
            <p><strong>TNA: </strong><em>To what extent has the leftist movement 
              gained power in Latin America? What factors led to this resurgence 
              and how was it possible?</em></p>
            <p><strong>Carvalho: </strong>Communist and pro-communist parties 
              rule about a dozen Latin American countries today. This fact, by 
              itself, is enough to prove that the &#8220;end of communism,&#8221; 
              proclaimed by the Right soon after the fall of the Soviet Union, 
              is a myth. World communism was never only an appendix of the USSR. 
              It actually created the USSR, not the other way around. It existed 
              a century before the Russian Revolution and continued to exist after 
              the nominal extinction of Soviet power. What made the resurgence 
              of communism easier &#8212; not only in Latin America, but around 
              the world &#8212; was the cowardly timidity of Western right-wingers 
              who, instead of taking the opportunity of the fall of the USSR to 
              punish the communists for their crimes, chose instead a policy of 
              &#8220;extending them a hand,&#8221; as if asking for their pardon 
              for having defeated them, and offering them all sorts of aid, enabling 
              them to reappear with a new or attenuated identity, even protecting 
              them from being called &#8220;communists&#8221; (the fashionable 
              euphemism is now &#8220;populism&#8221;). I believe that this absurd 
              surrender of the winners was also stimulated by powerful globalist 
              circles, whose interest in establishing worldwide bureaucratic controls 
              converges with the objectives of the communists. The number of billionaire 
              companies which came to openly contribute to leftist parties is 
              enormous. I call &#8220;meta-capitalists&#8221; the individuals 
              and groups which grew so wealthy with the market economy that they 
              can&#8217;t stand anymore being at the mercy of the free market 
              and seek, instead, to control everything, supporting bureaucracy 
              instead of capitalism. Meta-capitalists are natural allies of the 
              communists.</p>
            <p>An event that clearly symbolizes this union of apparent adversaries 
              was the tributes paid to Lula, the Brazilian President, who in the 
              same week was honored by the World Economic Forum in Davos, for 
              his conversion to capitalism, and by the S&atilde;o Paulo Forum, 
              for his allegiance to communism. The contradiction is only apparent. 
              At the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre, which for public opinion 
              embodies the opposite of the Davos Forum, the main demand was for 
              a greater control over the world economy by big international organizations. 
              Nobody there asked for shutting down the IMF or the World Bank, 
              what they wanted was the integration of &#8220;civil society&#8221; 
              &#8212; i.e., the World Social Forum &#8212; into those organizations. 
              Many European NGOs [non-governmental organizations] which participate 
              in the World Social Forum have a seat at the meetings of the World 
              Bank and other international organizations. The &#8220;ideological&#8221; 
              contrast serves only as propaganda. What we have is a gigantic symbiosis 
              of all globalist and statist forces around the world.</p>
            <p><strong>TNA: </strong><em>How have the Foro de S&atilde;o Paulo 
              and its members managed to become so influential? How can they be 
              stopped?</em></p>
            <p><strong>Carvalho: </strong>The S&atilde;o Paulo Forum, created 
              by Luis Inacio Lula da Silva and Fidel Castro in 1990 with the goal 
              of regaining in Latin America what had been lost in Eastern Europe, 
              is the strategic command of the communist and pro-communist movement 
              in the continent. Its membership includes over 100 legal political 
              parties as well as criminal organizations of drug traffickers and 
              kidnappers, such as the FARC (&#8220;Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias 
              de Colombia&#8221;) and the Chilean MIR (&#8220;Movimiento de Izquierda 
              Revolucionaria&#8221;). Legal parties cover up the activities of 
              criminal groups, and these provide undercover financial resources 
              to legal parties.... During 16 years big media and the establishment, 
              in Latin America and in the United States, refused to touch upon 
              the subject, handing to the strategists of the communist revolution 
              the protection of silence. Some of them, such as the expert in Brazilian 
              affairs at the Council on Foreign Relations, Kenneth Maxwell, even 
              openly denied the existence of the Forum, though by that time I 
              had already published, in my electronic newspaper <em>M&iacute;dia 
              Sem M&aacute;scara</em>, the complete official proceedings of its 
              annual meetings, which revealed with total clarity the scope of 
              its ambitions and goals.</p>
            <p>The Forum can only be stopped if the legal political parties in 
              its membership are taken to court for the criminal activities covered 
              up and protected by the organization. Brazilian President Lula, 
              who chaired the Forum for 12 years, signed in 2001 an agreement 
              of full support to the FARC, the same organization which provides 
              training and military assistance to criminal gangs in Rio de Janeiro 
              and S&atilde;o Paulo, such as the PCC (&#8220;First Command of the 
              Capital&#8221;) and the &#8220;Red Command,&#8221; which kill tens 
              of thousands of Brazilian citizens every year. When FARC or MIR 
              agents are arrested in Brazil, immediately Lula&#8217;s [Workers&#8217;] 
              Party, the PT [Portuguese: Portido dos Trabalhadores], acts to free 
              them. What is this if not complicity in crime? ... Meanwhile, communist 
              militants keep securing positions in the judiciary, so that as time 
              goes by any lawsuit brought against this alliance of leftists and 
              criminals becomes ever more unlikely to succeed.</p>
            <p><strong>TNA: </strong><em>What role have the Brazilian government 
              and Lula in particular played in expanding the leftist movement&#8217;s 
              power in Latin America? Is Lula a radical leftist, a moderate, or 
              somewhere in between? What do his policies -indicate?</em></p>
            <p><strong>Carvalho: </strong>Lula&#8217;s ideological convictions 
              don&#8217;t really matter, because they don&#8217;t even seem to 
              exist. What exists is his loyalty to his cohorts in the militancy 
              and to the commitments he made to the entities of the S&atilde;o 
              Paulo Forum, which, if unfulfilled, would bring against him all 
              the Latin American Left, leaving him without any support, not even 
              from the Right, which is by now so weak that its support is worthless. 
              A mediocre man doesn&#8217;t act out of convictions, but according 
              to the objective pressures of his group of reference. It&#8217;s 
              a waste of time to ask whether he &#8220;is&#8221; a true communist 
              within himself or not. Within Lula there is only emptiness and meanness, 
              but around him there is a well-organized structure of revolutionary 
              power which he serves well and will never stop serving.</p>
            <p>Foreign observers let themselves be impressed (or pretended to 
              do so) by Lula&#8217;s &#8220;orthodox&#8221; economic policy and 
              therefore concluded that he had changed his ideology. This is total 
              nonsense. Lula only adopted these policies so that he would not 
              have to fight two fronts simultaneously. Following the example of 
              Lenin&#8217;s &#8220;New Economic Policy,&#8221; he sought to appease 
              foreign investors while consolidating the power of leftist organizations 
              in internal politics (using copious amounts of public money to finance 
              them), and boycotting the Right in such a way that it is not able, 
              as he himself recently declared, even to present its own candidate 
              in the upcoming presidential elections [in October]. This will be 
              the third presidential election without any right-wing candidate. 
              As soon as it felt that the control of the Left over the country 
              had been consolidated, the ruling party threw off its mask of moderation 
              and began to propose radical measures such as state control over 
              the media, the right of leftist organizations to invade and take 
              rural properties as they see fit, etc.</p>
            <p><strong>TNA: </strong><em>Do you see the leftist resurgence as 
              a monolithic threat under central control or rather as a splintered 
              movement with various factions? Why? Assuming they exist, who are 
              the leaders?</em></p>
            <p><strong>Carvalho: </strong>Throughout history the revolutionary 
              movement has never depended on monolithic control to be able to 
              grow and prosper. Even during the period of Soviet hegemony, the 
              expansion of communism coexisted perfectly well with the deep internal 
              dissent that separated the Soviets from the Chinese and from the 
              radicalism of Latin America guerrillas. In the last dec-ades, the 
              communist movement has perfected even more its capacity to deal 
              with a variety of internal dissidences, using them as camouflage 
              and as instruments to adapt itself to local situations. The linear 
              party hierarchy, which had always been more an appearance than a 
              reality, has been totally replaced by a flexible organization of 
              &#8220;networks&#8221; connected via the Internet.... In Latin America, 
              the leadership of the revolutionary movement still belongs to the 
              founders of the S&atilde;o Paulo Forum: Lula, Marco Aur&eacute;lio 
              Garcia, Ricardo Kotscho, and others.</p>
            <p><strong>TNA: </strong><em>What role have Hugo Chavez and Venezuelan 
              Petrodollars played in this resurgence? Is the Cuban government 
              an important player?</em></p>
            <p><strong>Carvalho:</strong> Hugo Chavez is only a scarecrow that 
              the Latin American Left waves before the world to distract the attention 
              away from the S&atilde;o Paulo Forum, which is the true strategic 
              command of the Latin American revolution. Cuba and Venezuela are 
              important as shelters for terrorists and drug traffickers. In Venezuela 
              and other Spanish-speaking countries ruled by the S&atilde;o Paulo 
              Forum, there is strong and organized opposition, while in Brazil 
              all that is left is the Left itself, which controls the scene absolutely.</p>
            <p><strong>TNA: </strong><em>How significant and deep are the ties 
              of leftist leaders and political parties to terrorism and crime?</em></p>
            <p><strong>Carvalho: </strong>In Brazil, federal judge Odilon de Oliveira 
              gathered proofs showing that FARC&#8217;s narco-guerrillas ... control 
              a large chunk of local criminality. As a result, he became the most 
              persecuted man in Latin America and now has to live as a prisoner 
              in his own office, not being able even to go out to visit his family.... 
              The FARC also provide guerrilla training for the militants of the 
              &#8220;Landless Movement&#8221; (MST), an ironic name because that 
              entity is one of the biggest landowners in Brazil today. The MST 
              invades farms, destroys produce and equipment, sends away the (true) 
              workers, and is invariably rewarded for its actions, receiving enormous 
              sums of federal monies and the property of the invaded farms. Even 
              more ironically, the main factor for Brazil&#8217;s economic success 
              is the productivity of its big farms.... As for the Cuban government, 
              its connections to drug trafficking have been proved several years 
              ago in the book <em>The Mafia from Havana: The Cuban Cosa Nostra</em>.... 
              The same connections exist with the Venezuelan government, as demonstrated 
              by a report of the U.S. Congress from July 2009.... In Brazil, the 
              alliance between the FARC and local criminal gangs has made it absolutely 
              impossible to control crime activity. Nowadays, some 50,000 Brazilians 
              are murdered every year. Instead of repressing the gangs that produce 
              this insanity, the government grants them territorial autonomy and 
              is even cynical enough to propose, as a remedy, disarming the honest 
              population.</p>
            <p><strong>TNA: </strong><em>To what extent and in what way is the 
              U.S. government involved in the region?</em></p>
            <p><strong>Carvalho:</strong> For several decades now, the attitude 
              of the American government in the area has been ambiguous, to say 
              the least. Bill Clinton&#8217;s Plan Colombia only offered economic 
              and military aid to the Colombian government on the explicit condition 
              that ... criminal organizations of a political nature be preserved 
              [from] any damage. The result was that the old cartels were destroyed 
              and the FARC became the absolute rulers of drug trafficking in the 
              continent. In reality this kind of &#8220;war on drugs&#8221; is 
              a war that favors the Left against Latin America. The Department 
              of State is well informed about the S&atilde;o Paulo forum and its 
              Brazilian leadership. When it supports Lula under the pretext that 
              he is &#8220;a moderate,&#8221; in contrast with the &#8220;radical&#8221; 
              Hugo Chavez, it is actually camouflaging the real danger so that 
              it may grow sheltered from the sight of any intruder.</p>
            <p><strong>TNA: </strong><em>What role are multilateral and supranational 
              institutions like ALBA, MERCOSUR, the Andean Community, and UNASUR 
              playing in all of this? Could the integration process be used to 
              eventually absorb all of Latin America under authoritarian control?</em></p>
            <p><strong>Carvalho:</strong> All these organizations were created 
              under the inspiration of the idea of free trade, and there were 
              even some people who saw in them a sign of formidable capitalist 
              progress. However, we now understand that free trade is a double-edged 
              sword, which can also be used to dissolve national sovereignties 
              and to build upon their rubble a new structure of supranational 
              power. Many political analysts who only look at things from an economic 
              point of view fail to notice such danger. They imagine that the 
              expansion of commercial ties is by itself a vaccine against communism.... 
              Well, in today&#8217;s Latin America, the Left practically has the 
              monopoly of political action in its hands, and indeed this is so 
              much so that all those organizations you have mentioned &#8212; 
              all of them &#8212; are being used for the creation of a kind of 
              Union of Latin American Socialist Republics.</p>
            <p><strong>TNA: </strong><em>How serious is the threat of this resurgence? 
              What do you see happening in both the near future and the long run?</em></p>
            <p><strong>Carvalho:</strong> There is no unified answer that applies 
              to all Latin America. The situation is different in each country. 
              For example, however unbelievable it may seem, there is a strong 
              and organized resistance against the rise of neo-communism in Venezuela. 
              Colombia, likewise, is a remarkable center of resistance. On the 
              other hand, nowhere else has the Right been so utterly destroyed 
              as it has been in Brazil, which is, for this very reason, the headquarters 
              of Latin American revolution. When former Venezuelan presidential 
              candidate Alejandro Pe&ntilde;a set up UnoAmerica (Association of 
              Democratic Organizations of the Americas), the only international 
              organization devoted to fighting communism, he found no difficulty 
              in obtaining effective support in most of the Spanish-speaking countries, 
              but he has always had great difficulties finding support in Brazil.... 
              In other countries, however, the Left is not so culturally hegemonic, 
              which has made possible the organization of an effective and strong 
              anti-communist action. From this point of view, then, Venezuela 
              is in a better situation than Brazil, for if in the former country, 
              the Right has been oppressed, in the latter it has already died, 
              being now necessary to create a new Right out of nothing. In this 
              sense, American political analysts are always getting it all backwards: 
              They are alarmed at Venezuela and do not understand that the headquarters 
              of the revolution is in Brazil.</p>
