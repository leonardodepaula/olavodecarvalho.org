        <p><strong>WP: </strong><em>According to common perception, a revolution 
          was initiated in Poland in 1989 with historical significance and global 
          consequences. There is copious evidence that this allegedly anti-communist 
          revolt, which swept through Eastern Europe , was indeed planned by Soviet 
          secret services and served the long-term strategy of perestroika. In 
          Poland &#8216;s case the deception was facilitated by a secret agreement 
          between the communist party, leaders of the Solidarity movement and 
          the Catholic hierarchy &#8211; and we still see the consequences of 
          this arrangement. What is your opinion of the Eastern European revolutions? 
          Is it reasonable to claim that the Eastern part of the continent was 
          truly freed then?</em></p>
        <p><strong>Olavo de Carvalho: </strong>No, Eastern Europe was not truly 
          freed. But a fake liberation can easily be turned into a genuine one 
          if the secret manipulators are exposed and their power is transferred 
          to the hands of true patriots in due time . The time is now.</p>
        <p><strong>WP: </strong><em>Another small incident took place in August 
          1991 in Moscow. Bearing in mind the subsequent reign of Boris Yeltsin 
          and Vladimir Putin, are we dealing with the continuation of Soviet communism 
          or with a process of genuine democratisation? How did the changes in 
          Soviet Union in the last 17 years influence international political 
          scene?</em></p>
        <p><strong>Olavo de Carvalho:</strong> Would you believe that the Nazi 
          regime was truly defeated if at the end of World War II all the chieftains 
          of the Gestapo remained in their places, undisturbed by criminal investigations 
          and as powerful as they were before? The soviet state, the KGB and the 
          Russian Mafia are one and the same entity. The changes in the former 
          USSR were mostly a smokescreen designed to dupe the Western public opinion 
          and to dismantle any international anti-communist resistance. Needless 
          to say that the operation has been extremely successful.</p>
        <p><strong>WP: </strong><em>In the face of the revolutionary changes happening 
          in South America, should we speak of a rebirth of Marxism or is it merely 
          a continuation of old trends, ever present on that continent in the 
          twentieth century? Is the old idea of convergence between the socialist 
          and capitalist systems taking a new shape in the South American continent 
          or is it a completely new phenomenon?</em></p>
        <p><strong>Olavo de Carvalho:</strong> Socialism as an economic system 
          is a myth. Ludwig von Mises demonstrated, more than eighty years ago, 
          that under a socialist veil there remains always a market economy in 
          disguise. Socialism exists only as a &#8220;movement&#8221;, as a permanent 
          thrust for subversion and destruction. As such, it cannot survive without 
          the help it receives from big capitalists, or rather from the ones I 
          call metacapitalists &#8211; the macro-investors that were made so stunningly 
          rich by the capitalist game that they somehow transcend it and do not 
          accept the risks of a free market anymore. They then try to consolidate 
          their power as an oligarchy of political controllers. To this end they 
          use socialist subversion as their tool, and at the same time the socialist 
          leadership tries to use them as its tool. The so-called &#8220;convergence&#8221; 
          between socialism and capitalism is just a new ornamental denomination 
          for an old reality. Please read &#8220;The Best Enemy Money Can Buy&#8221; 
          by Anthony Sutton. Socialism is opposed to genuine free-market economy 
          (as well as to Christian civilizational values that sustain it), but 
          not to monopolistic and globalist capitalism. The main supporters of 
          the socialist subversion in Latin America are the American billionaire 
          foundations (Ford, Rockefeller, Soros) and the radical chic elite of 
          the American Democratic Party.</p>
        <p><strong>WP: </strong><em>What in your view are the consequences of 
          the emerging economic and military might of the communist China?</em></p>
        <p><strong>Olavo de Carvalho: </strong>It was perhaps some communist strategic 
          genius who persuaded Western investors that liberalizing the Chinese 
          economy would make the political regime to liberalize sooner or later. 
          Every smart communist knows that communism as an economic system does 
          not exist and will never exist, that it is only an ideological device 
          intended to keep alive the leftist revolutionary movement and communist 
          governments. The Chinese generals are smart communists.</p>
        <p>They know that even though socialist economy is incapable of surviving, 
          socialism as a movement and as accumulation of political power can not 
          only survive but prosper indefinitely through the simple trick of being 
          a parasite to capitalism. The current Chinese economic system is a sort 
          of organized summary of this knowledge, which by the way is not knew. 
          Nazi-fascist economy was already based upon it, as it strived to keep 
          a working market economy under state surveillance, sucking the resources 
          thus created to feed the unlimited growth of the one party and of the 
          state it created. A very similar scheme is being implemented in Brazil 
          today: the generous opening of the economy to foreign investors, simulating 
          the abandonment of the old socialist plans, contributes at the same 
          time to consolidate a highly centralized political system, in which 
          a group of leftist parties is increasingly eliminating all possibility 
          of opposition.</p>
        <p><strong>WP:</strong> <em>Later this year, some of us will commiserate 
          the ninetieth anniversary of the Bolshevik revolution. Do you believe 
          that communism is dead and buried (which seems to be the generally accepted 
          view)? Or do you believe that the Bolshevik&#8217;s heritage is still 
          playing a strong part in political practice today?</em></p>
        <p><strong>Olavo de Carvalho:</strong> Communism as a movement is more 
          alive than ever. As Anatolyi Golytsin well noted, there was a moment 
          in history when the international interests of the USSR came into conflict 
          with the impulse to further growth of the international revolutionary 
          movement. This conflict reached a point of rupture when it was necessary 
          to decide, to sacrifice the structure in favor of growth. It is not 
          a coincidence that right after the collapse of the USSR the communist 
          movement grew so fast to the point of creating a worldwide anti-American 
          siege &#8211; a Leninist dream that up to then had not been possible 
          to put into practice. To me it seems clear that the work of the KGB 
          through &#8220;active measures&#8221; abroad was much intensified precisely 
          since the beginning of the 1990's, exploring the widespread illusion 
          according to which the end of the USSR meant the end of communist subversion. 
          Lenin had prepared an expansion plan for the communist movement which, 
          in certain moments, seemed unachievable. He imagined that, starting 
          from Moscow , communist expansion should first reach Eastern Europe, 
          then turn back to Asia, move in the direction of Africa and, from there, 
          reach Latin America , thus completing the siege around the US and its 
          allies in Western Europe. There remains no doubt today that this course 
          has been run, that the siege is set. And its last chapter achieved success 
          precisely in the decade that followed the &#8220;end of the USSR&#8221;. 
          It is no coincidence that, in the leftist overtaking of Latin America, 
          drug-trafficking organizations have played such a fundamental role. 
          They are the financial and paramilitary base of the Sao Paulo Forum, 
          the strategic center of Latin American Communism, which gathers around 
          common plans and interests over a hundred legal leftist parties alongside 
          criminal organizations such as the FARC and the Chilean MIR. If in light 
          of these facts we reread today the book by Joseph Douglass <em>Red Cocaine 
          &#8211; The Drugging of American and the West</em> (London , 1990), 
          we realize the notable acumen of Soviet strategists who, already in 
          the 50's, were planning the use of drug-trafficking as a local source 
          of support for revolutionary movements in Latin America. It is rather 
          understandable that these plans could only have been more fully fulfilled 
          after the &#8220;end&#8221; of the USSR , as before they were hindered 
          by diplomatic commitments. At the same time, the dissolution of the 
          USSR made possible deep changes in the structure of the world revolutionary 
          movement, which provided it with an extraordinary and renewed mobility. 
          The ancient monolithic hierarchic organization was replaced by a horizontal 
          articulation in &#8220;networks&#8221;, which in less than 24 hours 
          can be mobilized via the Internet for mass action anywhere in the world. 
          The old concern with doctrinal unity gave way to an apparent pluralistic 
          confusion which, disregarding merely theoretical divergences, preserves 
          the strategic unity among thousands of ideologically diverse organizations. 
          In brief, the dissolution of the Soviet imperial structure enabled an 
          expansion of the communist movement, because it was designed precisely 
          for this purpose. Within the alchemic alternation of dissolution and 
          coagulation that dialectically guides communist strategy, the expansive 
          dissolution will be followed, sooner or later, by a new hierarchical 
          coagulation, but this time in a worldwide scale.</p>
        <p><strong>WP:</strong> <em>J&oacute;zef Mackiewicz, a great Polish writer 
          and anti-communist thinker, wrote in 1962 &#8220;Great is the capacity 
          of human nature to adapt to circumstances. Yet political realism ought 
          not to deprive people of their imagination because it will cease to 
          be realistic. A comparison of customs and manners prevailing in the 
          world in 1912 with those of today, can give us a measure, although only 
          in approximate terms, of what we could &#8220;reasonably&#8221; expect 
          to have to accept in year 2012!&#8221; What is your point of view in 
          this matter? What do the next five years have in store for us?</em></p>
        <p><strong>Olavo de Carvalho:</strong> If we apply Mackiewicz&#8217;s 
          observation to the analysis o f American foreign policy, we will see 
          that it has an outstanding prophetical accuracy. The school of the so-called 
          &#8220;realism&#8221;, inaugurated by Hans J. Morgenthau (<em>Politics 
          Among Nations: The Struggle for Power and Peace</em>, Fifth Edition, 
          Revised, New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1978), persuaded American strategists 
          that the power game in the world was a drama whose characters were essentially 
          Nations States. From this perception resulted the so-called &#8220;policy 
          of containment&#8221; which, directed exclusively by the timid idea 
          of containing Soviet military expansion to a reasonable area, gave up 
          the fight against Communism as an international movement. At the same 
          time, Communist parties quickly absorbed the strategic conception of 
          Antonio Gramsci which, favoring an informal expansion under the guise 
          of pluralism, turned the growth of Communism invisible to the eyes of 
          the ruling American elite. The latter even came to support this expansion 
          as it considered the &#8220;democratic left&#8221; in the Third World 
          as an alternative to Communism, without knowing that, from the Gramscian 
          viewpoint, the &#8220;democratic left&#8221; was exactly the preferred 
          instrument for camouflaged expansion. </p>
