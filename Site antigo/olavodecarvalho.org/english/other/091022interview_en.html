            <p><em>Alek Boyd: Perhaps you remember Olavo that, in November 2005, 
              we were part of a small group of people who were invited to brief 
              former US Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs 
              Tom Shannon, about the political situation in our respective countries. 
              I do remember, very vividly, your warnings about Lula during that 
              particular meeting. With the passing of time, I must say how pleasantly 
              surprised I am with the turn of perception vis-a-vis Hugo Chavez. 
              Mind you, in November 2005, the DoS still harboured the notion that 
              he was a democrat, purportedly just like Lula. However, recent developments 
              in Honduras show that Lula is as keen on interfering in other countries 
              internal affairs, as his Venezuelan counterpart. Yet one would be 
              hard pressed to conclude, by way of how mass media portrays the 
              Brazilian president, that such is in fact the case. For this reason, 
              taking into account that you are Brazilian, and that you have been 
              following your country's politics for longer than most reporters 
              are aware of Lula's very own existence, I would like to ask you 
              a few things about him, starting with: why do you think the media 
              is given him such benign treatment? Most analysts and media types 
              believe that Lula is a moderate, a democrat. How do you reconcile 
              that with, for instance, the foundation by Lula, at Fidel Castro's 
              personal request, of the Foro de Sao Paulo (FSP)?</em>
            <p>There is nothing there to be properly reconciled. The image and 
              the reality, in that case, are in complete contradiction to each 
              other. The legend of Lula, as a democrat and a moderate, only holds 
              up thanks to the suppression of the most important fact of his political 
              biography, the foundation of the S&atilde;o Paulo Forum. This suppression, 
              in some cases, is fruit of genuine ignorance; but in others, it 
              is a premeditated cover-up. Council of Foreign Relations&#8217; 
              expert on Brazilian issues, Kenneth Maxwell, even got to the point 
              of openly denying the mere existence of the Forum, being confirmed 
              in this by another expert on the subject, Luiz Felipe de Alencastro, 
              also at a conference at the CFR. I do not need to emphasize the 
              weight that CFR&#8217;s authority carries with opinion-makers in 
              the United States. When such an institution denies the most proven 
              and documented facts of the Latin American history of the last decades, 
              few journalists will have the courage of taking the side of facts 
              against the argument of authority. Thus, the S&atilde;o Paulo Forum, 
              which is the vastest and most powerful political body that has ever 
              existed in Latin America, goes on unknown to the American and, by 
              the way, also worldwide public opinion. This fact being suppressed, 
              the image of Lula as a democrat and a moderate does indeed acquire 
              some verisimilitude. Note that it was not only in the United States 
              that the media has covered up the existence and the activities of 
              the Forum. In Brazil, even though I published the complete minutes 
              of the assemblies of that entity, and frequently quoted them in 
              my column in the prestigious newspaper <em>O Globo</em>, from Rio 
              de Janeiro, the rest of the national media <em>en masse</em> either 
              kept silent, or ostensibly contradicted me, accusing me of being 
              a radical and a paranoid. When at last President Lula himself let 
              the cat out of the bag and confessed to everything, his speech, 
              published on the president&#8217;s official website, was not even 
              mentioned in any newspaper or TV news show. Shortly afterwards, 
              however, the name &#8220;S&atilde;o Paulo Forum&#8221; was incorporated 
              into video advertisements of the ruling party, becoming thus impossible 
              to go on denying the obvious. Then, they moved on to the tactic 
              of harm management, proclaiming, against all evidence, that the 
              S&atilde;o Paulo Forum was only a debate club, with no decisional 
              power at all. The minutes of the assemblies denied it in the most 
              vehement manner, showing that discussions ended up becoming resolutions, 
              unanimously signed by the members present. Debate clubs do not pass 
              resolutions. What&#8217;s more, the same presidential speech I have 
              just mentioned also disclosed the decisive role that the Forum played 
              in the sense of putting and keeping Mr. Hugo Ch&aacute;vez in power 
              in Venezuela. Nowadays, in Brazil, nobody ignores that I told the 
              truth about the S&atilde;o Paulo Forum and the rest of the media 
              lied.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, it is clear that Lula and his party, being the 
              founders and the strategic centre of the Forum, had to keep a low 
              profile, leaving to more peripheral members, like Hugo Ch&aacute;vez 
              and Evo Morales, the flashiest or most scandalous part of the job. 
              Hence, the false impression that there are &#8220;two lefts&#8221; 
              in Latin America, one democratic and moderate, and the other radical 
              and authoritarian. There are two lefts, indeed, but they are rather 
              the one that commands, and the other that follows the first&#8217;s 
              orders and thereby risks its own reputation. All that the Latin 
              American left has done in the last nineteen years was previously 
              discussed and decided in the Forum&#8217;s assemblies, which Lula 
              presided over, either directly until 2002, or through his deputy, 
              Marco Aur&eacute;lio Garcia, afterwards. The strategic command of 
              the Communist revolution in Latin America is neither in Venezuela, 
              nor in Bolivia, nor even in Cuba. It is in Brazil.</p>
            <p>Once the fact of the existence of the S&atilde;o Paulo Forum was 
              suppressed, what has given even more artificial credibility to the 
              legend of the &#8220;two lefts&#8221; was that the Lula administration, 
              very cunningly, concentrated its subversive efforts upon the field 
              of education, culture, and custom, which only affect the local population, 
              prudently keeping, at the same time, an &#8220;orthodox&#8221; economic 
              policy that calmed down foreign investors and projected a good image 
              of the country to international banks (a double-faced strategy inspired, 
              by the way, in Lenin himself). Thus, both the subversion of the 
              Brazilian society and the revolutionary undertakings of the S&atilde;o 
              Paulo Forum managed, under a thick layer of praise for President 
              Lula, to pass unnoticed by the international public opinion. Nothing 
              can illustrate better the duplicity of conduct to which I refer 
              than the fact that, in the same week, Lula was celebrated both at 
              the World Economic Forum in Davos, for his conversion to Capitalism, 
              and at the S&atilde;o Paulo Forum, for his faithfulness to Communism. 
              It is quite evident, then, that there is one Lula in the local reality 
              and another Lula for international consumption.</p>
            <p><em>Alek Boyd: Could you expand a bit on the sort of organization 
              the FSP is, and the democratic credentials of some of its members?</em></p>
            <p>The S&atilde;o Paulo Forum was created by Lula and discussed with 
              Fidel Castro by the end of 1989, being founded in the following 
              year under the presidency of Lula, who remained in the leadership 
              of that institution for twelve years, nominally relinquishing it 
              in order to take office as president of Brazil in 2003. The organization&#8217;s 
              goal was to rebuild the Communist movement, shaken by the fall of 
              the USSR. &#8220;To reconquer in Latin America all that we lost 
              in East Europe&#8221; was the goal proclaimed at the institution&#8217;s 
              fourth annual assembly. The means to achieve it consisted in promoting 
              the union and integration of all Communist and pro-Communist parties 
              and movements of Latin America, and in developing new strategies, 
              more flexible and better camouflaged, for the conquest of power. 
              Practically, since the middle of the 1990&#8217;s, there has been 
              no left-wing party or entity that has not been affiliated with the 
              S&atilde;o Paulo Forum, signing and following its resolutions and 
              participating in the intense activity of the &#8220;work groups&#8221; 
              that hold meetings almost every month in many capital cities of 
              Latin America. The Forum has its own review, <em>America Libre </em>(Free 
              America), a publishing house, as well as an extensive network of 
              websites prudently coordinated from Spain. It also exercises unofficial 
              control over an infinity of printed and electronic publications. 
              The speed and efficacy with which its decisions are transmitted 
              to the whole continent can be measured by its ongoing success in 
              covering up its own existence, over at least sixteen years. Brazil&#8217;s 
              journalistic class is massively leftist, and even the professionals 
              who are not involved in any form of militancy would feel reluctant 
              to oppose the instructions that the majority receives.</p>
            <p>The Forum&#8217;s body of members is composed of both lawful parties, 
              as the Brazilian Workers&#8217; Party itself, and criminal organizations 
              of kidnappers and drug traffickers, as the Chilean MIR (<em>Movimiento 
              de la Izquierda Revolucionaria</em>) and the FARC (<em>Fuerzas Armadas 
              Revolucionarias de Colombia</em>). The first is responsible for 
              an infinity of kidnappings, including those of two famous Brazilian 
              businessmen; the latter is practically the exclusive controller 
              of the cocaine market in Latin America nowadays. All of these organizations 
              take part in the Forum on equal conditions, which makes it possible 
              that, when agents of a criminal organization are arrested in a country, 
              lawful entities can immediately mobilize themselves to succour them, 
              promoting demonstrations and launching petition campaigns calling 
              for their liberation. Sometimes the protection that lawful organizations 
              give to their criminal partners goes even further, as it happened, 
              for example, when the governor of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, 
              Ol&iacute;vio Dutra, an important member of the Workers&#8217; Party, 
              hosted a FARC commander as a guest of state; or when the Lula administration 
              granted political asylum to the agent of connection between the 
              FARC and the Workers&#8217; Party, Oliv&eacute;rio Medina, and a 
              public office to his wife. Sometime before, Medina had confessed 
              to having brought an illegal contribution of $5 million for Lula&#8217;s 
              presidential campaign.</p>
            <p>The rosy picture of Brazil that has been painted abroad is in stark 
              contrast with the fact that from 40,000 to 50,000 Brazilians are 
              murdered each year, according to the UN&#8217;s own findings. Most 
              of those crimes are connected with drug trafficking. Federal Court 
              Judge Odilon de Oliveira has found out conclusive proofs that the 
              FARC provides weaponry, technical support, and money for the biggest 
              local criminal organizations, as, for instance, the PCC (<em>Primeiro 
              Comando da Capital</em>), which rules over entire cities and keeps 
              their population subjected to a terror regime. Just as I foretold 
              after the first election of Lula to the presidency in 2002, the 
              federal administration, since then, has done nothing to stop this 
              murderous violence, for any initiative on the government&#8217;s 
              part in that sense would go against the FARC&#8217;s interest and 
              would turn, in a split second, the whole S&atilde;o Paulo Forum 
              against the Brazilian government. In face of the slaughter of Brazilians, 
              which is more or less equivalent to the death toll of one Iraq war 
              per year, Lula has kept strictly faithful to the commitment of support 
              and solidarity he made to the FARC as president of the S&atilde;o 
              Paulo Forum in 2001.</p>
            <p><em>Alek Boyd: Why do you think worldwide media didn't pick up 
              on the fact that Lula's presidential campaign was illegally funded, 
              to the tune of $3 million, by Fidel Castro, as exposed by Veja?</em><br>
              <br>
              In face of facts like these, it is always recommendable to take 
              into account the concentration of the ownership of the means of 
              world communication, which has happened over the last decades, as 
              it has been described by reporter Daniel Estulin in his book about 
              the Bilderberg group. Even the more distracted readers have not 
              failed to notice how the opinion of the dominant world media has 
              become uniform in the last decades, being nowadays difficult to 
              perceive any difference between, say, <em>Le Figaro</em> and <em>L&#8217;Humanit&eacute;</em> 
              concerning essential issues, as, for example, &#8220;global warming,&#8221; 
              or the advancement of new leaderships aligned with the project for 
              a world government, as, for example, Lula or Obama. Never as today 
              has it been so easy and so fast to create an impression of spontaneous 
              unanimity. And since the CFR proclaims that the S&atilde;o Paulo 
              Forum does not exist, nothing could be more logical than to expect 
              that the S&atilde;o Paulo Forum disappears from the news.</p>
            <p><em>Alek Boyd: Other analysts have made the preposterous argument 
              that foreign intervention, imperialism by any other word, has never 
              characterized Itamaraty's policy. In light of &quot;union leader&quot; 
              Lula's direct intervention in helping Chavez overcome the strike 
              in 2002-03 by Venezuelan oil workers, by sending tankers with gasoline, 
              how would you explain such blatant ignorance?</em></p>
            <p>Itamaraty&#8217;s traditions, however praised they were in the 
              past, no longer mean anything at all. Today, the Brazilian diplomatic 
              body is nothing but the tuxedoed militancy of the Workers&#8217; 
              Party. At the same time, the intellectual level of our diplomats, 
              which had been a reason of pride since the times of the great baron 
              of Rio Branco, has formidably declined, to the point that nowadays 
              the intellectual leadership of the class is held by geniuses of 
              ineptitude, such as Samuel Pinheiro Guimar&atilde;es. No wonder 
              then that everywhere now our ambassadors are simple agents of the 
              S&atilde;o Paulo Forum. It cannot be said that this properly expresses 
              Brazilian imperialism, for our Ministry of Foreign Relations does 
              not hesitate to sacrifice the most obvious national interests before 
              the altar of a more sublime value, which is the solidary union of 
              the Latin American left. There is no Brazilian imperialism, but 
              rather S&atilde;o Paulo Forum&#8217;s imperialism.</p>
            <p><em>Alek Boyd: Do you think Marco Aurelio Garcia is behind Zelaya's 
              return to Honduras, as has been alleged? If yes, it is evident that 
              is a matter of a FSP member coming to the rescue of a fallen comrade, 
              but what's in it for Brazil?</em></p>
            <p>The Brazilian government denies having something to do with that, 
              but Zelaya himself confessed that his return to Honduras had been 
              previously arranged with Lula and his right-hand man, Marco Aur&eacute;lio 
              Garcia. The most evident thing in the world is that this grotesque 
              installation of Zelaya in the Brazilian embassy is an operation 
              of the S&atilde;o Paulo Forum.</p>
            <p><em>Alek Boyd: Given that Tom Shannon is now US Ambassador to Brazil, 
              would you reiterate what you told him about Lula, and his partners 
              in crime, in November 2005, or would you advise differently?</em></p>
            <p>Tom Shannon did not pay due attention to us in 2005 and this was, 
              no doubt, one of the causes of the aggravation of the Latin American 
              situation since then. It is likely that he read Maxwell&#8217;s 
              and Alencastro&#8217;s speeches at the CFR, and thought that such 
              a prestigious institution deserved more credibility than a handful 
              of obscure Latin American scholars with no public office or political 
              party. Unfortunately, we, not the CFR, were the ones who were right.</p>
            <p><em>Alek Boyd: Finally, as in the case of Chavez, has Lula done 
              enough institutional damage to remain in power, or will he hand 
              over power democratically?</em></p>
            <p>The alternation in presidential power no longer has any great meaning, 
              for the two dominant parties, the Workers&#8217; Party and the Brazilian 
              Social Democratic Party, act in concert with each other and, despite 
              minor differences in the administrative economic field, they are 
              equally faithful to the overall strategy of the Latin American left. 
              Lula himself has celebrated as a big victory of democracy the fact 
              that there are only leftist candidates for the 2010 presidential 
              elections, as if the monopoly of the ideological control of society 
              were a great democratic ideal. On the other side, the most celebrated 
              of the so-called &#8220;opposition&#8221; leaders, former president 
              Fernando Henrique Cardoso, has already acknowledged that between 
              his party and the Workers&#8217; Party there is no substantive ideological 
              or strategic difference, but only a contest for offices. It matters 
              little who will win the next elections, for, in any event, the orientation 
              of the Brazilian government must remain the same: in the social 
              and juridical field, overpowering subversion; in the economic field, 
              moderation to anesthetize foreign investors. The only difference 
              that may arise is in the field of security, in the case that the 
              candidate of the Brazilian Social Democratic Party, Jos&eacute; 
              Serra, wins, for his party, despite being as much a left-wing party 
              as the Workers&#8217; Party, does not formally belong to the S&atilde;o 
              Paulo Forum, being therefore free to do things against organized 
              crime, which Lula himself could never do. As governor of the state 
              of S&atilde;o Paulo, Serra showed to be the only Brazilian political 
              leader who pays attention to the slaughter of his fellow-countrymen. 
              It is still early to know whether or not he will be able to do what 
              he did in his state, but it is certain that he would wish to do 
              it.</p>
