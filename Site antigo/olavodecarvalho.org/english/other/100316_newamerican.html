          <div> 
            <p>Many Cuban refugees risked everything to escape the murderous regime 
              of Fidel Castro. Oftentimes they made treacherous voyages aboard 
              rickety rafts, hoping only to reach the free shores of Florida with 
              their lives. Many died along the way. But communist rule was vicious 
              and unforgiving.</p>
            <p>So when the Berlin Wall came down and the Iron Curtain was raised, 
              people around the world breathed a sigh of relief. It was generally 
              accepted that it would only be a matter of time before communism 
              fell everywhere, including Latin America. But instead, something 
              else happened south of the border &#8212; it morphed and continued 
              its march through the region with unprecedented ease.</p>
            <p>Now, there is a new wave of people fleeing Latin American tyranny 
              and arriving in Miami. Jorge Bastidas, 57, was a successful small 
              business owner on the touristy Venezuelan island of Margarita when 
              avowed socialist Hugo Chavez seized the reins of power in 1998. 
              A lot of Venezuelans liked Chavez in the beginning, Bastidas said, 
              &#8220;but once in power, he took off the mask and revealed a monster.&#8221; 
              The effects of his policies soon hit home. </p>
            <p>&#8220;When he took over, the economy of our island was devastated,&#8221; 
              Bastidas told <em>The New American</em>. &#8220;It went down and 
              down and down until whole shopping malls, hotels, restaurants &#8212; 
              all kinds of businesses really &#8212; were forced to shut down. 
              And we got caught up in this too &#8212; it was horrible.&#8221;</p>
            <p>In addition to the economy crumbling, crime and insecurity exploded, 
              as persecution of the political opposition began. &#8220;I was a 
              member of an organization that was opposed to Chavez,&#8221; explained 
              Bastidas, also a father of two children. &#8220;And so, it happened: 
              Any person who did not support him became his enemy. We were persecuted 
              to the point where it became intolerable, and so when the opportunity 
              arose, we had to leave.&#8221;</p>
            <p>Bastidas has not returned home since that fateful day, but if Chavez 
              is ever ousted, he would like to. Unfortunately, though, he isn&#8217;t 
              hopeful. &#8220;That man will never &#8212; never &#8212; leave 
              power through votes, of this I&#8217;m certain. He cheats!&#8221;</p>
            <p>Not everybody was as lucky. Many middle-class business owners have 
              had their businesses and property seized and have nowhere to run. 
              And as Chavez grows increasingly authoritarian &#8212; backed up 
              by friendly neighboring regimes, a seemingly endless supply of &#8220;petrodollars,&#8221; 
              and shiploads of sophisticated Russian weaponry &#8212; Venezuela 
              has unquestionably descended into full-blown totalitarianism.</p>
            <p>The socialist leader routinely threatens to jail political opponents, 
              even arresting a sitting Governor for allegedly conspiring against 
              him. The former Defense Minister was also imprisoned after publicly 
              opposing Chavez&#8217; unconstitutional power grab to remain in 
              office indefinitely.</p>
            <p>The regime shut down six television stations just this year for 
              failing to broadcast all of Chavez&#8217; speeches. It has closed 
              dozens of radio stations that were not sufficiently supportive. 
              Now, Chavez wants to jail broadcasters who don&#8217;t abide by 
              his &#8220;regulations.&#8221;</p>
            <p><strong>Leftists Advance: Nation by Nation</strong><br>
              The Venezuelan people are not the only ones suffering under this 
              resurgence of fanatical left-wing leaders.</p>
            <p>The BBC reported in 2005 that 75 percent of South Americans were 
              governed by leftist rulers, all of whom had risen to power in the 
              preceding six years. And the trend has only accelerated since then, 
              with some analysts using the term &#8220;Pink Tide&#8221; to describe 
              the phenomenon that has enveloped Latin America.</p>
            <p><em>Bolivia</em>: With strong backing from Chavez, former coca 
              farmer Evo Morales of the Movement for Socialism assumed power in 
              2006. His party now controls about two-thirds of both Parliamentary 
              houses and has already &#8220;redistributed&#8221; over 60,000 acres 
              of land. Foreign capital has nearly vanished. But incredibly, the 
              government promises to intensify its efforts.</p>
            <p><em>Ecuador</em>: Radical leftist Rafael Correa, another proponent 
              of Chavez&#8217; &#8220;21st Century Socialism,&#8221; became President 
              in 2007. &#8220;Socialism will continue,&#8221; he boldly announced 
              after being elected, ending his victory speech with communist mass-murderer 
              Ernesto Che Guevara&#8217;s famous words &#8220;Hasta la victoria 
              siempre&#8221; (until victory always/forever). </p>
            <p><em>Brazil</em>: Latin America&#8217;s largest nation has been 
              under the thumb of a charismatic radical left-wing President since 
              2003 &#8212; though he does a better job of concealing his true 
              intentions than other rulers in the region. A former labor leader 
              who helped found the Workers&#8217; Party, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva 
              has poured vast sums into wealth redistribution and various &#8220;anti-poverty&#8221; 
              schemes. Though widely seen and presented as a &#8220;moderate,&#8221; 
              he is far from it. In conjunction with communist despot Fidel Castro, 
              &#8220;Lula,&#8221; as he is affectionately known, spawned a powerful 
              socialist cabal that united leftist terrorists, social movements, 
              and political parties in an astoundingly successful effort to conquer 
              Latin America for the Left.</p>
            <p><em>Nicaragua</em>: Revolutionary Marxist and Sandinista Daniel 
              Ortega re-assumed leadership in 2007, despite a long record of violent 
              rule and accusations by his stepdaughter of systematic sexual abuse 
              (he was never prosecuted owing to governmental immunity and the 
              statute of limitations). In a bid to extend his power, Ortega&#8217;s 
              first act in 2010 unconstitutionally extended the terms of corrupt 
              but supportive judicial officials under the guise of &#8220;stability.&#8221;</p>
            <p>Other nations that have come under control of leftist leaders in 
              the last dec-ade include Uruguay, Chile, Argentina, Paraguay, El 
              Salvador, the Dominican Republic and other Caribbean nations, and 
              more. Many of the rulers came to power in questionable elections, 
              with accusations of fraud running rampant. And in the few nations 
              that have not already fallen to extremist left-wing governments, 
              leftist forces often represent the main opposition parties. Examples 
              of this include Peru, Colombia, and Costa Rica. </p>
            <p><strong>Supranational Integration</strong><br>
              In addition to the proliferation of left-wing regimes, a variety 
              of new supranational governments are emerging that threaten to centralize 
              the left-wing totalitarianism and impose it on the few remaining 
              holdouts.</p>
            <p>One of the most dangerous transnational leftist integration schemes 
              is the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our Americas (ALBA), 
              which includes Venezuela, Cuba, Bolivia, Ecuador, Nicaragua, Honduras, 
              Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, and Saint Vincent. The regional union 
              is held together by disdain for the United States, capitalism, and 
              liberty in general. It has already begun using a new transnational 
              currency known as the SUCRE in commercial exchanges through the 
              ALBA bank, and further &#8220;integration&#8221; is planned.</p>
            <p>A broader regional government known as the Union of South American 
              Nations includes every nation on the continent (except French Guiana, 
              which is part of France). The &#8220;Bank of the South,&#8221; or 
              BancoSur, is headquartered in Caracas, Venezuela, while the &#8220;South 
              American Parliament&#8221; will likely be located in Bolivia. Currently 
              led by socialist Ecuadorian President Correa, the scheme includes 
              a military alliance called the South American Defense Council, a 
              developing &#8220;common market,&#8221; and even plans to introduce 
              a common currency. The integration process, modeled on the European 
              Union, is expected to be completed in less than a decade.</p>
            <p><strong>Driving Force</strong><br>
              Socialism&#8217;s present stature in the southern latitudes shouldn&#8217;t 
              have been altogether unexpected, as the poor and middle classes 
              in those countries revolted against false promises made by power-hungry 
              &#8220;rightist&#8221; politicians and governments that sold the 
              people on a type of corrupt capitalism peddled as free-market capitalism. 
              While purporting to support freedom and free markets, these leaders 
              often engage in a type of crony capitalism instead of true liberalization-oriented 
              reforms.</p>
            <p>In nation after nation that was supposedly turning toward capitalism, 
              the state provided absurd benefits to politically connected businesses 
              or elites at the expense of the people (like selling state-owned 
              enterprises or assets at fire-sale prices to the ruling elite, who 
              then improperly reap massive profits and continue to run inefficient 
              monopolies).</p>
            <p>With promises of prosperity, leftist regimes have been able to 
              dupe the peoples into voluntarily surrendering their freedom, property, 
              and any legitimate chance at future prosperity.</p>
            <p>But this phenomenon alone could not possibly account for the firm 
              grip that statists now hold over the reins of power in Latin America. 
              Other factors figure in.</p>
            <p>According to acclaimed Brazilian writer and philosopher Professor 
              Olavo de Carvalho, over a dozen current governments in Latin America 
              are connected through a shadowy, powerful, and little-known organization 
              called the Foro de S&atilde;o Paulo (S&atilde;o Paulo Forum &#8212; 
              FSP). The name refers to the Brazilian city where it was founded 
              in 1990 by Castro, the Sandinistas, and Lula (the supposedly &#8220;moderate&#8221; 
              president of Brazil). It is essentially a network comprised of over 
              100 leftist political parties, various social movements, and several 
              guerrilla terrorist organizations such as the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias 
              de Colombia (FARC) and the Chilean Movimiento de la Izquierda Revolucionaria 
              (MIR), among others. In recent years, bad publicity has forced the 
              FSP to discourage leftist terrorist groups from sending official 
              representatives to meetings. But according to experts and various 
              reports obtained by <em>The New American</em>, this is merely a 
              public-relations gimmick.</p>
            <p>President Lula, who led the FSP for many years, defended the group 
              and its collaboration with the FARC and other terrorist groups, 
              saying that &#8220;18 years ago, in almost every South American 
              country, there were political currents which argued that the only 
              possible way to achieve power was violent struggle,&#8221; the AFP 
              reported in a 2008 article. &#8220;In 1990, we created the S&atilde;o 
              Paulo Forum, where we invited the entire Latin American Left to 
              participate.&#8221;</p>
            <p>Carvalho told The New American that the FSP &#8220;is the strategic 
              command of the communist and pro-communist movement in the continent.&#8221; 
              According to the group&#8217;s founding declaration, the mission 
              is to, among other objectives, &#8220;renew leftist and socialist 
              thought&#8221; and &#8220;to reaffirm its emancipating character.&#8221; 
              Eventually its aims grew to include Latin American &#8220;integration&#8221; 
              as well. And this is exactly the trend that has taken hold in the 
              region.</p>
            <p>Attempts to contact a spokesman for the FSP were unsuccessful. 
              But despite the claims of its defenders, critics argue that the 
              FSP is much more sinister than simply a &#8220;democratic&#8221; 
              leftist vehicle.</p>
            <p>But how did this secretive group become so powerful? &#8220;The 
              Forum would never have accumulated so much power if its activities 
              had been denounced from the outset, but during 16 years, big media 
              and the establishment, in Latin America and in the U.S., refused 
              to touch upon the subject, handing to the strategists of the communist 
              revolution the protection of silence,&#8221; said Carvalho, possibly 
              the most important individual involved in exposing the FSP.</p>
            <p>Another factor is the support of powerful converging interests 
              that include everything from governments and monopolistic businesses 
              to drug traffickers and criminal organizations. &#8220;Legal parties 
              cover up the activities of criminal groups, and these provide undercover 
              financial resources to legal parties,&#8221; explained Carvalho.</p>
            <p>Another crucial factor in the Latin American leftist resurgence 
              is the assistance of former Soviet officials and other international 
              connections, according to Toby Westerman, editor of <em><a href="http://www.inatoday.com/">International 
              News Analysis</a></em> and author of <em>Lies, Terror and the Rise 
              of the Neo-Communist Empire &#8212; Origins and Direction.</em></p>
            <p>Westerman told <em>The New American</em> that a worldwide alliance 
              including Communist China, Islamic fundamentalism, Iran, leftist 
              Latin American rulers and guerrillas, and other forces were all 
              collaborating in a war against the United States, united by their 
              &#8220;anti-human, anti-God&#8221; ideology. &#8220;[The Russians] 
              are running the same game, just slightly different &#8212; it&#8217;s 
              more of a franchise operation than a central corporate operation, 
              if you will. But if you take Russia out of it, the whole thing collapses.&#8221;</p>
            <p>Indeed, the Russians have been supplying advanced weaponry to regimes 
              like Chavez&#8217;. Russian National Security Council Chief Nikolai 
              Patrushev actually attended the most recent ALBA summit last year. 
              And China and Iran have both jumped on the bandwagon as well, cooperating 
              with a variety of unsavory Latin American governments in myriad 
              sectors and projects.</p>
            <p>&#8220;We are creating a new world, a balanced world. A new world 
              order, a multipolar world,&#8221; Chavez told reporters during a 
              visit to Communist China, one of many. His &#8220;new world order&#8221; 
              includes China, Iran, Japan, and a significantly weakened United 
              States, he explained.</p>
            <p>The Latin American leftists and the FSP have also received support 
              from more &#8220;mainstream&#8221; Western European groups as well. 
              The &#8220;European Left&#8221; (EL), a group that describes itself 
              as an alliance of &#8220;left socialist, communist, and red-green 
              parties in the European Union,&#8221; met in 2009 with representatives 
              of the FSP and entered into a number of agreements for mutual assistance. 
              To that end, the groups also developed &#8220;a linking mechanism, 
              efficient and stable, between the [FSP] Secretariat, its regional 
              secretaries, and the Executive Board of the EL,&#8221; according 
              to a joint statement released by the EL.</p>
            <p>So aside from any genuine discontent with false leaders on the 
              so-called Right and the false image they have attached to free markets, 
              there is a complex, interlocking network working in unison to advance 
              what is essentially a new socialist revolution in Latin America. 
              Hiding in the shadows, this network has had remarkable success in 
              achieving its goals. And though the role of the U.S. government 
              is hotly debated, U.S. policies are certainly not helping matters. 
            </p>
            <p><strong>U.S. Involvement</strong><br>
              Nearly every expert interviewed by <em>The New American</em> for 
              this story had a different take on how the United States factors 
              into the leftist resurgence. One view is that the U.S. government 
              is secretly waging war against the leftist advances &#8212; at least 
              the &#8220;21st Century Socialism&#8221; faction. &#8220;Bolivia 
              and Ecuador, and more generally the region&#8217;s burgeoning social 
              movements and Left political forces, are as much targets of this 
              counteroffensive as Venezuela,&#8221; said William Robinson of the 
              Latin American and Iberian Studies Program at the University of 
              California. He claims the U.S. government is using a sophisticated 
              combination of &#8220;military threats and hostilities with psychological 
              operations, disinformation campaigns, black propaganda, economic 
              sabotage, diplomatic pressures and the mobilization of political 
              opposition forces inside the country&#8221; with the aim of provoking 
              Chavez and other regimes into a &#8220;crackdown that transforms 
              the democratic socialist process into an authoritarian one.&#8221; 
            </p>
            <p>But is the &#8220;Yankee empire&#8221; really waging a covert battle 
              against the forces of communism and socialism in Latin America? 
              Probably not, according to most analysts. One expert dismissed the 
              notion as &#8220;nonsense.&#8221; If anything, the U.S. government 
              has remained largely indifferent, he said. Others argue that the 
              United States has, in fact, aided the revolution.</p>
            <p>While the U.S. government has traditionally been perceived as opposed 
              to leftist regimes in Latin America, the Obama administration took 
              a different stance in Honduras, openly siding with Chavez, Castro, 
              and the FARC in demanding the return to power of Honduras&#8217; 
              criminal leftist President Manuel Zelaya after he was ousted for 
              flagrant constitutional violations.</p>
            <p>There has also been indirect U.S. involvement in the region, and 
              this may prove more important than overt actions such as intervening 
              on Zelaya&#8217;s behalf. The United States is likely one of the 
              largest financiers of the leftist movements in Latin America, whether 
              intentionally or not. Half of Venezuela&#8217;s oil is sold to the 
              United States, for example, while Chavez uses his petrodollars to 
              help finance the socialist revolution throughout the region.</p>
            <p>And while the U.S. government stifles and blocks domestic oil exploration 
              (forcing consumers to purchase it from leftist Latin American regimes 
              or anti-American Middle Eastern governments), it is simultaneously 
              helping finance Brazil&#8217;s government-owned oil firm Petrobras&#8217; 
              offshore exploration to the tune of billions of U.S. dollars. In 
              addition, $1.8 billion in U.S. foreign aid flowed to regimes in 
              Latin America and the Carribean just in 2005, including more than 
              $50 million to Brazil.</p>
            <p>Of course, no discussion of U.S. involvement in the region would 
              be complete without mentioning the role of Plan Colombia and the 
              Merida Initiative. Essentially, the United States unconstitutionally 
              provides billions of dollars, weapons, training, and intelligence 
              to partner nations in Latin America &#8212; Mexico and Colombia 
              in particular &#8212; in a supposed effort to combat the drug trade. 
              But the effect of this &#8220;war&#8221; has turned out to be a 
              boon for certain well-connected, leftist narco-terrorist groups, 
              especially the FARC, which had many of its competitors eliminated 
              courtesy of the U.S. taxpayers.</p>
            <p>Analysts interviewed by <em>The New American</em> for this story 
              had varying opinions about the anti-drug &#8220;aid,&#8221; with 
              some arguing that it is indispensable and others claiming it is 
              counterproductive. But as the War on Drugs intensifies, supply inevitably 
              diminishes and risk increases, thereby raising prices and making 
              the trade more lucrative and by extension providing more funding 
              for leftist Latin American guerrillas and terrorists to purchase 
              weapons and spread their ideology. It also gives leftist leaders 
              a rallying cry to unite their populations against foreign intervention 
              and a scapegoat on which to pin the results of their disastrous 
              policies.</p>
            <p><strong>Consequences</strong><br>
              The statist swing in Latin American governments has not delivered 
              on promises of decreasing poverty or improving life for the common 
              people. In fact, it has done the opposite.</p>
            <p>Venezuela, despite its oil revenues, has been forced to start rationing 
              water and electricity, even though the country has bountiful fresh 
              water supplies and some of the largest known oil reserves in the 
              world. And despite government efforts to boost domestic food production, 
              the nation has been forced to import ever increasing amounts just 
              to sustain itself. Chavez was also forced to devalue the Venezuelan 
              currency in January. And if the nation continues on its current 
              path, the devastation will only intensify.</p>
            <p>Ecuador, Bolivia, and other leftist regimes find themselves in 
              a similar situation. And Cuba, which has suffered under decades 
              of communist authoritarianism, is the most extreme testament of 
              the horrors wrought by central planning: It is one of the poorest 
              nations on Earth (along with other communist states like North Korea).</p>
            <p>&#8220;All of these countries, especially Venezuela and Ecuador, 
              are running their economies into the ground,&#8221; University of 
              Miami&#8217;s Department of International Studies Chair Bruce Bagley 
              told The New American, referring primarily to ALBA members. &#8220;The 
              state-run economies of Latin America in the past have proven disastrous 
              and they&#8217;re going to prove disastrous now.&#8230; So, I do 
              see that socialism of the 21st century is on its last legs.&#8221; 
              But the expansive role of the state in Latin American economies, 
              according to Bagley, will continue for a long time to come.</p>
            <p><strong>Outlook</strong><br>
              But there may still be hope. After electing hard-core socialist 
              president Michelle Bachelet in 2006, Chilean voters in January rejected 
              the radical Left and instead opted for the more moderate Sebasti&aacute;n 
              Pi&ntilde;era, who represents what is considered a &#8220;center-right&#8221; 
              party. In Panama, voters last year threw out committed leftist Mart&iacute;n 
              Torrijos and replaced him with the supposedly more freedom-friendly 
              Ricardo Martinelli.</p>
            <p>A top Latin American executive with a Fortune 50 multinational 
              firm spoke with <em>The New American</em> on condition of anonymity 
              and explained that he remained optimistic about the future business 
              climate in Latin America, citing Colombia as one example of a nation 
              that has made progress and continues to move in a positive direction. 
              &#8220;Obviously, businesses are looking to invest in places with 
              stable and reliable economies,&#8221; he said, adding that this 
              could potentially improve the political environment of the region.</p>
            <p>There is also a large coalition of groups opposed to the FSP and 
              the leftward march of the region&#8217;s governments. The Union 
              de Organizaciones Democraticas de America (UNOAmerica) is a Latin 
              American umbrella group with around 200 member organizations. It 
              exists to promote freedom and counter the FSP and its authoritarian 
              allies in the region. And its president, Alejandro Pe&ntilde;a Esclusa, 
              remains optimistic about the future of freedom as well.</p>
            <p>&#8220;[The FSP] has built within it the seeds of its own destruction,&#8221; 
              Esclusa told <em>The New American</em> from the jungles of Colombia. 
              &#8220;Once they are in power, they are not able to create wealth, 
              so eventually, the movement will be defeated.&#8230; But even though 
              it is destined to fail, in the meantime, it can destroy a lot.&#8221;</p>
            <p>But while some analysts think the resurgent Left will inevitably 
              fail, others are not so optimistic. Brazilian Professor Carvalho 
              thinks more drastic measures are required. &#8220;The Forum can 
              only be stopped if the legal political parties in its membership 
              are taken to court for the criminal activities covered up and protected 
              by the organization,&#8221; he explained.</p>
            <p>And the time for that might well be running out: &#8220;When we 
              present these facts to self-proclaimed right-wing leaders, to business 
              leaders and even to high-ranking army officers, they chicken out 
              and pretend they didn&#8217;t see anything,&#8221; Carvalho told 
              <em>The New American</em>. &#8220;Meanwhile, communist militants 
              keep securing positions in the judiciary, so that as time goes by 
              any lawsuit brought against this alliance of leftists and criminals 
              becomes ever more unlikely to succeed.&#8221;</p>
