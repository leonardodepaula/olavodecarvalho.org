      <div> 
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This week I had the pleasure of interviewing the Brazilian philosopher, 
          and president of <a href="http://theinteramerican.org/">the Inter-American 
          Institute</a>, Olavo de Carvalho. During the conversation I suggested 
          that something is wrong with our thinking today; that we don&#8217;t 
          worship in the same way, or obey the rules in the same way, or observe 
          common courtesy as we once did. &#8220;To someone like me,&#8221; he 
          began, &#8220;who visited this country in the 1980s, and came back to 
          live here in 2005, the changes that the American mind has undergone 
          in recent decades are really shocking.&#8221;</p>
        <p>Carvalho recommended that I read Tamar Frankel&#8217;s book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Trust-Honesty-Americas-Business-Crossroad/dp/019517173X/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1298040728&sr=1-3">Trust 
          and Honesty: America's Business Culture at the Crossroad</a>, which, 
          he explained, &#8220;describes the alarming decline of moral standards 
          in the American business world....&#8221; According to Frankel's book, 
          the erosion of trust and honesty has to do with a rising acceptance 
          and justification of fraudulent practices. &quot;What has changed,&quot; 
          she writes, &quot;is the attitude towards dishonesty and breach of trust. 
          Today, there is a greater acceptance and more justification of dishonesty.&quot; 
          How did this come about? With the removal of certain barriers to fraud, 
          temptation has increased.</p>
        <p>Carvalho has his own insights into the causes of moral and intellectual 
          deterioration in America: &#8220;One of the factors that has brought 
          about this change, with its highly corrosive consequences in the daily 
          lives of Americans, was the fashionable &#8216;neo-liberalism,' which 
          saw the business world as a self-regulatory power, able to override 
          morality, religion, and culture and to dictate standards of conduct 
          based on the supposedly miraculous power of market laws. What made the 
          greatness of America was not just the free market economy, but a synthesis 
          of this with Christian morals and with a culture that included love 
          of country and family. Separated from these regulating forces, the capitalist 
          economy becomes an engine of self-destruction, which is exactly what 
          is happening today.&#8221;</p>
        <p>Undoubtedly, there is truth in the assertion that traditional American 
          society has collapsed, being replaced by &#8220;the open society,&#8221; 
          so named by George Soros and Karl Popper. According to Carvalho, the 
          open society defines itself as &#8220;not recognizing any transcendent 
          values and by leaving everything at the mercy of economic conveniences 
          &#8211; conveniences that are something alleged even to justify the 
          very demolition of the free market and its replacement by the welfare 
          state, based upon taxation and debt.&#8221; In other words, Carvalho 
          is saying that the free market doesn&#8217;t make men good. It does 
          not train them to be moral. It does not bother to defend itself against 
          socialism. Those elements in society that previously instilled moral 
          values are no longer as effective, if they are effective at all.</p>
        <p>It is Carvalho&#8217;s view that the &#8220;open society&#8221; concept 
          has been used by the nation&#8217;s enemies to destroy &#8220;everything 
          that is good and great in this country.&#8221; He then pointed to the 
          Russian geopolitical thinker, Alexander Dugin, and &#8220;the emerging 
          Russian-Chinese scheme....&#8221; Using a subtle propaganda, noted Carvalho, 
          the &#8220;open society&#8221; becomes a pretext for fostering widespread 
          global hatred against the United States. For the &#8220;open society&#8221; 
          produces moral degradation that is subsequently blamed on the American 
          way of life, which supposedly demonstrates the special wickedness and 
          decadence of the American people. This leads directly to a discussion 
          of the evils of American cultural imperialism -- the rallying cry of 
          Russian and Chinese strategists whose goal is the elimination of the 
          United States as a world power. The effectiveness of this approach should 
          not be underestimated. As Carvalho explained, &#8220;The Russian-Chinese 
          influence has been growing more and more in Latin America. The U.S. 
          Government has missed this because it still sees Russia and China as 
          allies, in spite of the fact that they are the two largest weapons suppliers 
          to terrorism around the world. One must remember that the Putin government&#8217;s 
          foreign policy is today guided by the so-called &#8216;Eurasian&#8217; 
          strategy, invented by Russian philosopher Alexander Dugin, who proposes 
          that Russia, China, and Islam ally with all the anti-American forces 
          in Western Europe, Africa and Latin America, <em>for the purpose of 
          laying final siege to the United States</em>. This strategy already 
          has strong military support in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, 
          a kind of eastern version of NATO, which brings together Russia, China, 
          Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan.&#8221;</p>
        <p>I asked Carvalho about recent reports of a deal between Islamic Iran 
          and communist Venezuela to build a strategic missile base aimed at the 
          United States. I asked if the Marxists of South America were allied 
          with al Qaeda and Tehran. &#8220;Yes, they are,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;They 
          are also allied with the ETA, which is a Basque terrorist organization. 
          There are lots of agents of these organizations in Hugo Chavez&#8217;s 
          entourage. This fact is not unknown to many Latin American governments, 
          but most of them are committed to remaining silent about it because 
          of the agreements they signed as members of the Sao Paulo Forum, the 
          spearhead of the communist movement in Latin America.&#8221;</p>
        <p>I then asked Carvalho to name the countries working with the terrorists 
          worldwide for the destruction of the United States. He replied as follows: 
          &#8220;Iran, Syria, North Korea, Cuba, Russia, and especially China 
          are the main ones. In Latin America, Venezuela is the most obvious example, 
          but Venezuela would be nothing without the support it gets from all 
          the governments of the Sao Paulo Forum, the leader of which is Brazil.&#8221;</p>
        <p>According to Carvalho, the Left continues to consolidate its position 
          in Latin America. &#8220;It has been following a strategy explicitly 
          presented in a Chinese communist congress a few years ago: to take power 
          by means of legal elections and then erode the democratic system from 
          the inside to prevent the opposition from ever coming back to power 
          in future elections,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;This is to say: they 
          win a first match and then proceed to change the rules of the game. 
          In Brazil this strategy has led to spectacular results. First, the idea 
          was to limit the political field to only two contestants: radical Left 
          and moderate Left. All other forces were dismantled by means of targeted 
          tax audits and corruption charges which did not even need to be proved, 
          since they destroyed reputations once and for all as soon as they were 
          trumpeted by the media.&#8221;</p>
        <p>Could America&#8217;s traditional ally in South America be under the 
          control of a totalitarian movement? How could we miss such an astonishing 
          development? &#8220;American opinion-makers have a wrong view of Brazil,&#8221; 
          said Carvalho, &#8220;because the Brazilian government has always acted 
          in a two-faced and camouflaged way. On the one hand, it has been courting 
          American investors to strengthen the Brazilian economy, but on the other, 
          it has been taking advantage of economic success in order to consolidate 
          the Leftist sway at home, to make impossible any political opposition 
          which is not that of the moderate left, and to give effective support 
          to the rise of the Left in neighboring countries, while protecting openly 
          terrorist organizations like the FARC and the Chilean MIR, which thus 
          have ended up controlling the local criminal organization and getting 
          the monopoly of the drug market in Brazil. In Venezuela, Hugo Chavez 
          has also dismantled the opposition, but using more blatant methods.&#8221;</p>
        <p>Since Brazil harbors the core of the communist movement in Latin America, 
          how is the anti-American campaign progressing? According to Carvalho 
          the Left is not always able to move forward. &#8220;It follows an alternating 
          rhythm,&#8221; he explained, &#8220;according to whether the important 
          thing at the moment is to flatter foreign investors or to unify and 
          strengthen the Latin American Left.&#8221;</p>
        <p>&#8220;For more than ten years,&#8221; Carvalho noted, &#8220;I have 
          been warning that the Worker&#8217;s Party [in Brazil] is not an organization 
          like the others; that is, willing to alternate with the opposition in 
          power. The Worker&#8217;s Party is a revolutionary organization committed 
          to reshaping the state and the entire society after its image and likeness, 
          by using, for this purpose, the vilest and most corrupt resources. Since 
          no one has ever believed any of this, everyone has kindly disarmed himself 
          in the face of this rising party, and now that it controls everything, 
          no one can do anything against it. Brazil is governed by a single party 
          which has several names. I see no prospect of changing this situation 
          in the short or medium term.&#8221;</p>
        <p>I asked Carvalho about Chile, which turned away from the Left in its 
          last elections. Of all the countries in South America, what is the secret 
          of Chile&#8217;s apparent conservatism? &#8220;The Chilean elite is 
          infinitely more educated and better morally prepared than the Brazilian 
          elite,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;When things start to move towards the 
          abyss, the Chileans are able to understand what is happening and change 
          course before disaster occurs. You cannot imagine the intellectual laziness 
          of Brazilian businessmen, politicians and military people. Even when 
          the situation becomes alarming, they cling to their comfortable and 
          usual beliefs and refuse to inform themselves on what is really happening. 
          The wealthy classes in Brazil are presumptuous and helpless. They do 
          not know how to resist the subtle game of blandishments and threats 
          played by the Leftist government that controls them. Not only in Chile 
          but also in Argentina, the elites are much better prepared to face such 
          a situation.&#8221;</p>
        <p>And what is the most important thing Americans should know about the 
          present political situation in South America? &#8220;The most important 
          thing,&#8221; said Carvalho, &#8220;is the deep and solid unity of the 
          local Leftist movements across national borders, the unity of the revolutionary 
          strategy that lies behind seeming and misleading differences of national 
          character. There are no &#8216;two Lefts&#8217; in Latin America. There 
          is only one Left, which has so much solidarity with itself that it never 
          loses control of the two faces it employs to fool American observers.&#8221;</p>
        <p>Hearing Carvalho characterize the Brazilian business and political 
          elite as intellectually lazy, I could not help thinking of the American 
          elite. They have also refused to changed course in the face of approaching 
          disaster. Even as the situation becomes alarming, they spend more and 
          more money. They court enemies and betray allies. It is true, as well, 
          that they &quot;do not know how to resist the subtle game of blandishments 
          and threats played by the Leftist&quot; power.<br>
