      <p>And Charles Sanders Peirce generated William James, who generated John 
        Dewey, who generated Richard Rorty, who, upon his arrival in Brazil, generated 
        great <i>frisson</i> and mental confusion among the natives. Let us go 
        back to the origins.
      <p>Peirce says that the only meaning of an idea lies in the practical consequences 
        that may be inferred from it. This thesis, the core of Peircean philosophy, 
        is what originated its denomination as pragmatism: <i>pragma</i>, in Greek, 
        are the matters of practical life. Ironically, this thesis is not applicable 
        in practice, because there is a significant difference &#150; and frequently 
        an abysmal separation &#150; between the practical consequences that may 
        be inferred from an idea, through logical conjecture, and the practical 
        consequences that an idea actually brings forth in time.
      <p>For example, the proletarian revolution and the classless state may be 
        logically inferred from Marxism, as its intended consequences. But in 
        practice, its actual consequences were a military coup and the establishment 
        of a dictatorship of a new class. Which of these two orders of consequences 
        represents the "true meaning" of Marxism? Peirce says that the meaning 
        lies in the "sum" of the consequences. But in the present case the sum 
        equals zero, because the two orders of consequences &#150; the intended 
        one and the actual one &#150; logically exclude each other. This way, 
        it would only be left for us to say that, from the pragmatical point of 
        view, Marxism has no meaning. But this would contradict the fact that 
        it had actual practical consequences indeed.
      <p>On the other hand, how are we to distinguish between the practical consequences 
        that an idea brings forth by itself from those that stem from its accidental 
        mixture with other distinct, heterogenous and contradictory ideas?. Or 
        from the unpredictable troubles that follow its dissemination in human 
        society? In order to be able to make this distinction, we would have to 
        recognize that the idea has some meaning independently from and before 
        any practical consequences it may bring forth. But this would be a confession 
        that it does have a meaning as a mere representative scheme, as an image 
        of the real, what would amount to a denial of all pragmatism. The alternative 
        then would be to admit that accidental consequences constitute a part 
        of the meaning of ideas, what in turn would lead us to conclude that any 
        idea can mean anything , depending on what accidents come to do with it 
        along the way of its dissemination. Reasoning along this line, we would 
        reach the conclusion that African-Brazilian religions such as <i>umbanda</i> 
        constitute part of the original meaning of the Christian idea, for accidents 
        in Brazilian history have produced a fusion of that idea with African 
        rites. Or we would come to believe that AIDS is an intrinsic part of the 
        meaning of love, as love has led some people to contract AIDS. In the 
        same way, nothing would prevent us from interpreting pragmatism as an 
        idealism, since Royce, a disciple of Peirce, became by chance an absolute 
        idealist.
      <p>In a blatant contradiction with himself, Peirce asserts, moreover, that 
        the scientific method must seek only the truth, without regard for its 
        practical consequences. What is so special about the idea of the sicentific 
        method that it can be endowed with a meaning without any regard for its 
        practical consequences if these, according to the same Peirce, are the 
        only possible meaning of an idea?
      <p>Even more curious is the Perceian denial of all intuitive evidence. For 
        Peirce, we do not have any intuitive faculty, and all our knowledge consists 
        of thought made up with signs, on the basis of knowledge of external facts. 
        But are these external facts known intuitively or are they also just signs? 
        And how can something that has not been perceived intuitively be a sign 
        of anything else? How can we reconcile the denial of intuitive evidence 
        with the concept of "sign"? A sign, says Peirce, "is anything that, for 
        someone, corresponds to something from a certain aspect". Then how could 
        there be any sign without the intuive evidence of this "anything", or 
        of the identity or difference between the "anything" and the "somehting"? 
        If this blessed "something" is also only a sign &#150; and not an effective 
        presence that is intuitively perceived &#150; then we are confronted with 
        signs of signs of signs, and so on endlessly. This will simply liquidate 
        any possibility of a practical use for signs, be it even as simple conventional 
        lies.
      <p>Even worse, I do not see how to reconcile the denial of evidence with 
        the trust that Peirce has in the power of logic. Logic is nothing without 
        the priciple of identity, which is either an intuitive evidence or a simple 
        convention accepted by the scintific community. If it is a simple convention, 
        its validity depends on a numeric consensus, what would reduce it to a 
        mere "tenacious reaffirmation of an authority" (sic), a method of validation 
        that Peirce himself considers anti-scientific.
      <p>For Peirce, intuitive evidence has a mere subjective validity since it 
        varies from one individual to the other. Here he mistakes evidence, in 
        the logical-ideal sense, for the psychological act of intuition &#150; 
        naturally subjective and fallible &#150; and then this latter one for 
        the mere feeling of certitude that not only accompanies intuitions but 
        also beliefs, wishes and hallucinations. In short, he confounds the logic 
        and the psychologic, confusion that is the trademark of <i>psychologism</i>, 
        of which pragmatism is but a version (and against which it is not necessary 
        to argue. It suffices to refer to the "Introduction" of Husserl's <i>Logical 
        Investigations</i> ).
      <p>Peirce asks: if intuition is a direct perception, how can we know that 
        we have intuitions? Can we, by intuition, know that we have intuitions? 
        He considers this a fulminating argument against intuition. But the the 
        answer to this last question is simply "yes". If I cannot have an intuition 
        that I have an intuition, I cannot have any intuition at all. Intuition 
        is <i>necessarily accompanied by self-consciousness</i>. If not, it would 
        confound itself with a pure and simple corporal sensation. If I see, but 
        I do not have the intuition that I see, I cannot speak of a visible intuition 
        but only of an optical sensation, unaccompanied by a cognitive conscience, 
        as it is obvious. A man who, as Peirce, does not recognize that he has 
        an intuition, is either lying or is in a state of schizofrenic dissociation, 
        by denying his very self-conscience. But Peirce is a bit more pretentious 
        than the common schizofrenic in that he demands that we too deny our self-conscience.
      <p>If the intuitive evidence has no value, the individual alone cannot know 
        anything and therefore Peirce says "it is necessary a whole community 
        of researchers to objectively test the truthfullness of any idea". But 
        if each of these researchers is not capable of individually recognizing 
        an intuitive evidence or a personal certitude that is universaly valid, 
        <i>who</i> will add up their points of view to synthesize them in an "objective 
        truth"? Peirce seems to believe that the academic community exists by 
        itself<i>,</i> as an Aristotelian <i>substantia prima,</i> displaying 
        a unitarian self-conscience capable of certitude, even though such self-conscience 
        is absent in the individuals that make up the community. The academic 
        community is thus a being endowed with a conscience, formed by the sum 
        of various unconscious individuals. Peirce is a sociological transcendentalist.
      <p>Furthermore, from this viewpoint, if the only meaning of an idea lies 
        in its practical consequences, what practical consequences may be inferred 
        from the denial of individual intuition? It is inferred that each human 
        individual, not being able to trust his own self-conscience, will deny 
        all the intuitive evidences that might come to him. For not ever being 
        able to rely on himself, he will have to surrender to the authority of 
        the all-powerful academic community. The practical result of this idea 
        is to reduce humanity to a herd of docile animals, incapable of personal 
        understanding and always in need of the endorsement of the "scientific" 
        authority.
      <p>In a still deeper level, Peirce affirms that no truth constitutes an 
        evidence in itself. It must be corroborated by some independent proof. 
        But he forgets to say that this independent proof is also worth nothing 
        in itself and that it needs other independent proofs, and so on endlesslly. 
        This culminates by neutralizing any possible meaning of the statement 
        that no truth is evident in itself.
      <p>The truths that are evident by themselves, he adds, mean nothing in science 
        and must be corroborated by a scientific, "objective and public" criterion. 
        Now, the validity of any proof rests ultimately on logical principles, 
        which are either evident by themselves or arbitrary conventions. Peirce 
        does not accept that there are self-evident truths, neither that arbitrary 
        conventions have any value. Thus, there are simply no logical principles 
        that may support any proof whatsoever. The only alternative left to Peirce 
        is to resort to the authority of the scientific "public", that is, to 
        the authority of the larger number, to which, on the other hand, he denies 
        any scientific validity. It all comes to a dead end, and perhaps for that 
        very reason this "philosophy" exerts such a fascination in an age that 
        displays such a fancy pleasure in letting itself be the prey of all kinds 
        of psychologic labirints.
      <p>According to Peirce, the doctrine of intuition, when it affirms that 
        thoughts may directly incarnate its objects, is based on the confusion 
        between sign and what is signified. This is nonsense. Intuition <i>is 
        not</i> a thought or a representation, but rather a direct presence, like 
        this page before the eyes of the reader, a presence that imposes itself 
        to his conscience, without signs and without "thought". If something is 
        perceived through signs, there is no intuition in this act of perception.. 
        It seems that Peirce mistakes the act of intuition for the mere remembrance 
        of something that has just been the objetc of that intuition, which is 
        certainly a sign. Anyone knows the difference between having the intuition 
        of a presence and remembering an absence. Only Peirce does not know it, 
        or pretends not to know it .
      <p>Thus, Peirce's apology of practice notwithstanding, pragmatism is refractory 
        to any practical application because it is intrinsicaly contradictory. 
      <p>It is also disastrous the result to which we arrrive by applying to pragmatism 
        the pragmatic method of defining an idea by its practical consequences. 
        The fundamental practical consequence of pragmatism is to absorb the voided 
        individual consciences in an onipotent "scientific community" endowed 
        with extra-human powers and incapable, in turn, of obtaining the proof 
        of its beliefs by any means other than a majority vote in academic sessions. 
        This is its <i>logical</i> consequence, deductible from its concept alone, 
        as it was also its actual, historically verified, consequence. It is what 
        we see from the fact that Richard Rorty &#150; the latest offspring of 
        the Peircean family &#150; already explicitly recognizes the law of the 
        larger number as the only valid criterion of knowledge, thereby showing 
        to the world the true face of pragmatism, a face that not even its founder 
        had the courage to look in the eye.<br>
