      </p>
      <p>A public that is contaminated by Marxist indoctrination to the marrow 
        does not have – exactly because of that – the slightest idea it is being 
        indoctrinated. The first step of indoctrination is purely cultural, diffuse, 
        and does not aim to give the individual any explicit political conviction 
        whatsoever, but only to shape his cosmovision according to the basic guidelines 
        of the Marxist philosophy, given without that name, naturally, and presented 
        as if it was general Knowledge, with a capital &quot;K&quot;. With the 
        exception of an extremely reduced number of intellectuals that have studied 
        critically the communist movement, and of the people that are too poor 
        to have received any education at all, rarely do we find a Brazilian citizen 
        that is not already taken with this vision of the world, at least because 
        they ignore it is a vision and not the world itself. </p>
      <p>In especial, the explanation of history based in the Marxist scheme of 
        the economically defined classes, which is the background for a more active 
        indoctrination, can already be considered totally integrated to the thought 
        schema of the media and the educated population, to the point that no 
        one there has the awareness that it is just a theory among many. Everyone 
        takes this theory as a direct translation of the reality we live. Even 
        if it has little to do with the real distribution of forces in the Brazilian 
        social panorama, the individual spontaneously appeals to its basic concepts 
        – if not to its nomenclature – to express what he thinks is going on in 
        society. Thus, for example, the state bureaucracy, instead of being viewed 
        as an autonomous force, which is a characteristic trait of Brazilian society 
        – and even though inside it is recruited the most part of the leftist 
        militancy –, has become invisible enough that the effects of its actions 
        can be attributed to the &quot;dominant class&quot;, understood in the 
        sense of &quot;the rich&quot; or &quot;the capitalists&quot;. The middle 
        class, who encompasses 46% of our population and includes almost all of 
        the politically active people (especially from the left), has no conscience 
        of itself as a distinct entity. Each person inside it, spontaneously, 
        divides the social picture between &quot;the rich&quot; and &quot;the 
        poor&quot;, taking the party discourses as if they were trustworthy translations 
        of the underlying sociological realities, and putting themselves among 
        the poor, without noticing that the poor put them among the rich and, 
        actually, envy and hate them more than any banker. The alienation between 
        social reality and the self-explanatory discourse, in such circumstances, 
        is total. </p>
      <p>With equal ease, the comprehension of ideas as stereotyped expressions 
        of class interest is projected over the image of our historical past, 
        leveling like a bulldozer the fact that is easily proven – but Marxistically 
        unexplainable – that in Brazil the ideological discourses almost never 
        coincide with the objective interests of the social classes involved. 
        In public education, in books, in the so-called educational programs on 
        TV, the Marxist reduction of the cultural production to superstructures 
        of class interests are already so deeply imbued in the current vocabulary 
        that whoever desires to present some other version of history does not 
        know where to start to explain himself and can even fall into the ridiculous 
        situation of charging head-on into &quot;common sense&quot; (in the Gramscian 
        sense of the term). </p>
      <p>In a very comprehensible manner, but no less ironic because of that, 
        the more limited the horizon of a person is to the canons of the Marxist 
        vulgate, the more violently will this person react to the statement that 
        there is Marxist propaganda in Brazil and, even more, to the idea that 
        the communists have any power among us. Being invisible, as René Guénon 
        used to say, is a thing of the essence of power itself. </p>
      <p>A second phase of indoctrination is the one that will associate, to the 
        class stereotype, the moral and emotional values necessary to awaken reactions 
        of pleasure or displeasure whether the discourse sounds like something 
        associated with the &quot;class interests&quot; of the kindly poor or 
        the evil rich, even if, objectively, it has little to do with that. The 
        discourse in favor of free enterprise, for instance, even though it speaks 
        objectively in favor of an immense part of the poor population that makes 
        a living from the informal economy, is rejected as a defense of the interests 
        of the &quot;élite&quot; and of the multinational companies, while the 
        state-centralizing discourse, even though it does not make the least scratch 
        in the interests of the richer class, and in fact strengthens the omnipotent 
        bureaucracy that reduces the country to poverty through a scorching tributary 
        burden, is better accepted as the expression of the interests of the &quot;excluded&quot;. 
        From alienation we then move on to hallucination. But, not by coincidence, 
        this same anguish that comes from the vague intuition of madness is immediately 
        used to generate more hate towards the stereotyped image of the &quot;dominant 
        class&quot; – held responsible for all the evils and personified in individuals 
        and groups that, in truth, are not dominant at all and function only as 
        scapegoats, such as the military. To such an extent do these conventional 
        symbols substitute the perception of the facts that an event like the 
        World Social Forum, in Porto Alegre, is passively accepted by its nominal 
        value of antiglobalist manifestation, regardless of the support it receives 
        from ONU, the heart of the New World Order, as well as from a world network 
        of Non-Governmental Organizations, that are to ONU what the arteries and 
        veins are to the heart.</p>
