      </p>
      <p>The current tide of attacks on Catholic clergy is entirely grounded on 
        a very few cases of pedophilia, registered along more than ten years in 
        several countries. But recurring repetitions of the same old news create 
        an association between pedophilia and Catholicism in the soul of the public, 
        and such identification is even more reinforced by supposedly qualified 
        opinions suggesting the bond between the phenomena and clerical celibacy.<br>
        <br>
        To those whose thinking is based upon stereotypes and clich&eacute;s, 
        the news are truly astonishing, and the image it conveys is surprisingly 
        convincing.<br>
        <br>
        Let us admit: those who are apt to reason with facts and numbers constitute 
        a trifling minority. But for such minority it is crystal clear that the 
        accusations say the exact opposite of what they will; for what they really 
        show it that pedophilia is less frequent among catholic fathers than among 
        members of any social group we may choose by way of comparison.<br>
        <br>
        As a sample, let me pick two of the major beneficiaries with the church 
        demoralization: on the one hand, gays; on the other hand, the international 
        bureaucracy that today substitutes the clergy in the mission of watching 
        over the childhood welfare.<br>
        <br>
        A recent study by Judith Reisman, the celebrated author of Kinsey, Crimes 
        &amp; Consequences, shows that the chances of child harassment by male 
        homosexuals are five times greater than those of male heteros commiting 
        such crimes. In short, homosexual pedophiles are much more relapsing.<br>
        <br>
        Furthermore, among the victims of male pedophiles, there are 20 boys for 
        each girl.<br>
        <br>
        If even such a significant statistic constant doesn't justify a worldwide 
        stream of anti-gay alarmism, then why would a laughable set of ten cases, 
        carefully clipped by the media, justify the worldwide anti-Catholic prevention?<br>
        <br>
        But even further, when it comes to gays, there's not a mere statistic 
        constant: there's the brute fact of induction to pedophilia by representative 
        gay magazines.<br>
        <br>
        In his work &quot;Child Molestation and the Homosexual Movement&quot;, 
        soon to be published by Regent University Law Review - though the reviews 
        circulate on the web already -, jurist Steve Baldwin reveals some discoveries 
        he made in the gay bibliography available in the market. Observe these 
        three, randomly gathered from the showcase:<br>
        <br>
        1. Journal of Homosexuality, a prestigious pro-gay publication, published 
        a whole special issue under the grotesquely euphemistical title of &quot;Inter-generational 
        Male Intimacy&quot;, whereon several articles presented pedophilia as 
        a &quot;love relationship&quot;<br>
        <br>
        2. Larry Elder, founder and head of an activist gay group, wrote in his 
        book Report from the Holocaust: &quot;In that cases of childs having sex 
        with older homosexuals, I affirm that frequently, very frequently, the 
        child desires the act and maybe even claims for it&quot; (non-literal 
        translation)<br>
        <br>
        3. The Advocate, one of the most influential gay magazines, regularly 
        advertises a rubber doll, model &quot;Penetrable Boy... available in three 
        teasing positions&quot;!<br>
        <br>
        But saying that the gay community is the pedophiles per capita record-holder 
        would be unfair. For such cup, meanwhile at least, seems to pertain to 
        those 'saviours' who took upon the duty of watching over the protection 
        and moral education of the children of the world: the United Nation social 
        workers.<br>
        <br>
        Data of the entity's general secretary herself give us notice of the fact 
        that, solely in the year of 2001, the number of complaints presented by 
        eastern Africa refugees against those multinational child teasers reached 
        400. And four hundred episodes in a single year, in a single community, 
        shape - unequivocably I guess - a case of mass pedophilia. And with the 
        repugnant detail that the victims haven't been gathered in the streets 
        or schools, but among starving and ailing people, the miserable masses, 
        who, in extreme despair, have surrendered in the hands of these monsters, 
        relying innocently on their help promise.<br>
        <br>
        This is a real scandal of worldwide proportions, a crime against Humanity 
        in the most strict sense Nuremberg has defined the expression.<br>
        <br>
        But UN social workers are untouchable. They're the new clergy, encharged 
        of spreading the &quot;politically correct&quot; gospel of tomorrow's 
        Humanity throughout the world. To denounce them would be to promote the 
        immediate miscarriage of that so-called &quot;humanist&quot; ideology 
        that inspires all international media assaults on Catholic priesthood.<br>
        <br>
        That is why the world press keeps silent, dissuading the public's attention 
        to selectively chosen instances where the word &quot;priest&quot; figures 
        as a crime emblem.<br>
        <br>
        After all, doesn't the Church, just as Christ himself, exist to take away 
        the world's sins?</p>
