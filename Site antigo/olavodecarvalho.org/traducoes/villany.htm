      </p>
      <p>When someone tells me that communism is a thing of the past, that to 
        warn against it is like beating up a dead horse, I sometimes have the 
        suspicion that I am speaking with a villain. Not that that particular 
        fellow is necessarily a villain. But, in fact, only a villain would let 
        1,2 billion people that still live under the communist tyranny pass as 
        a negligible amount, an infinitesimal quantity in the infinite. Only a 
        villain would disregard as irrelevant the 40 monthly executions of Chinese 
        women (and their doctors) that refused to practice abortion. Only a villain 
        would persuade himself that, only because half a dozen of American companies 
        are making money in Peking (as if they hadn’t already made a bunch in 
        Lenin’s Russia), communism became as harmless as a stuffed toy rhino. 
        Only a villain would pretend to ignore that, after the dissolution of 
        the URSS, no KGB agent was fired, much less punished, and that the greatest 
        instrument of espionage, of political police, of state terror and of institutionalized 
        torture that ever existed in the universe, with a budget bigger than all 
        the western secret services combined, continues to work as if nothing 
        had happened. </p>
      <p>Only a villain would induce people to ignore these things so that, when 
        the revolution that is being prepared in Brazil with money from drug dealing 
        comes to power, no one realizes they are reliving the tragedy of Russia, 
        China, and Cuba. </p>
      <p>For we do not have to look abroad, all we have to do is look at Brazil 
        itself to see the monstrous power that the communist movement, whatever 
        name you give it – for along its history it changed names many times according 
        to its interests of the time – has been acquiring day after day. Only 
        as an example, the diffusion of communist ideas in schools, of which many 
        Brazilians are not even aware of, and that others insist in ignoring on 
        purpose (among them our Minister of Education), has already moved from 
        the simple &quot;indoctrination&quot; stage to the more direct and frank 
        rape of consciousness. In thousands of public schools, teachers paid by 
        taxpayer money are using their influence and their power not only to install 
        the cult of genocidal leaders and the myth of socialist democracy, but 
        also to intimidate and punish any child that does not agree to repeat 
        their teacher’s discourse. The slightest divergence, sometimes a single 
        doubt, subjects the student to embarrassment in front of the class, placing 
        in him the fear for the future of his academic and professional life. 
        My own children have gone through this, and I receive monthly dozens of 
        emails with similar reports. Calling this &quot;propaganda&quot;, &quot;indoctrination&quot;, 
        is terminological euphemism by someone that does not want to be aware 
        of the gravity of the situation. And the situation is such that psychological 
        terrorism has already imposed its domination over children’s hearts, preparing 
        them to accept, as a normal, inevitable and even a good thing, a government 
        of assassins and psychopaths like the one still in power in Cuba and the 
        one that is already installed in the regions under the domination of the 
        Farc. </p>
      <p>In face of that, Brazilians react... covering up facts with words, blunting 
        the conscience with soporiferous clichés, exhibiting that air of pretense 
        calm that betrays the fear, the panic of facing reality. Will I say this 
        is naiveté? No. Naiveté has nothing of the verbal shrewdness required 
        for such self-deceit. </p>
      <p>A reader, all puffed up with false science, writes to me saying that 
        communism was no more violent than the religious wars, than the Holy Office, 
        than the burning of witches or the Night of S. Bartolomeu. With that air 
        of “papa knows it all” of an elementary school teacher, he mentions the 
        horror of Montaigne before the cruelty of the civil wars of his time, 
        and concludes that &quot;violence was always present in all the different 
        stages of history&quot;. Nothing like a catch phrase to make a Brazilian 
        shine, saying things he does not understand. Nothing like a beautiful 
        cliché to level, in a uniform verbal paste, the most prodigious differences. 
        The Spanish Inquisition, the cruelest tribunal that was ever heard of 
        before the 20th century, killed 20 thousand people along four centuries. 
        The Leninist government did the same in just a few weeks. Furthermore, 
        all the examples of mass cruelty observed along History happened because 
        of wars against other states, other tribes or other religious groups. 
        The Soviet repression was the first case of permanent statal violence 
        against unarmed civilians, in a time of peace. The example proliferated. 
        When the Germans started sending the Jewish to Auschwitz, 20 million Russians 
        had already been killed by the Soviet government. Even at the end of this 
        macabre work, in 1945, Nazism, with all of the genocidal structure set 
        up for this intent, was not able to equal the productivity of the Soviet 
        death industry. </p>
      <p>Under whatever aspect we examine, socialism is in no way a decent idea, 
        which could be discussed calmly as a viable alternative for a country, 
        or one that can – without committing a crime of intellectual pedophilia 
        – be inoculated in school children.  It is a hideous, macabre doctrine, 
        not the least bit better than nazi ideology, and that, in a paroxysm of 
        cynicism, dares to cry out in the name of morals, when it condemns acts 
        of excess and violence that are much smaller, and that its adversaries 
        committed in the zeal of stopping its homicidal march of devourer of peoples 
        and continents. </p>
      <p>As soon as we accept the infernal logic of its propaganda, we will darken 
        our intelligence, lose our sense of truth and our sense of proportions. 
        We will even lose the sense of before and after. They inoculate in us, 
        for instance, the notion that the Brazilian guerrilla was the only way 
        out that was given them by the repressive government that, in March 31, 
        1964, closed all the doors to legal opposition. But how can this be, if 
        the guerrilla started in 1961, always directed from and financed by Cuba? 
        They tell us that &quot;Operation Condor&quot; was an international conspiracy 
        among dictatorships, to suffocate pacifist and democratic movements. But 
        how can this be, if such operation only came to be later, in response 
        to a three-continent armed movement, directed from Havana and financed 
        by soviet money? Before the lessons of the socialist masters, we unlearn 
        even the instinctive sense of the temporal order of facts. </p>
      <p>Believing in these people, even for a brief instant, is to dismantle 
        our own brain, is to destroy in our souls the ability to make even the 
        most elementary and self-evident distinctions. That is why I do not have 
        any patience left with people who consent that their children be subject 
        to this kind of stupefaction. For a while, I imagined that they were only 
        idiots, cowards or sluggards. But idiocy, cowardice and laziness have 
        limits: after a certain point, they are transformed in the finer and most 
        subtle modality of villainy. </p>
