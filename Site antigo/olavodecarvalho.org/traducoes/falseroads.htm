      <p align=left><b>They help you understand nothing about the terrorist attacks</b></p>
      <p align=center>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Two weeks after the attacks, all the most obvious and predictable mistakes 
        of analysis, which would be a shame for someone of average intelligence, 
        have occurred, with the easiness of the unconscious, by the wise men in 
        charge, who give their opinion about the matter. We’ll consider three, 
        and their respective authors.</p>
      <p>First: consider the crime a legitimate reaction against the “aggressive 
        militarism of the U.S.” Authors: practically all leftist intelligentsia 
        in the Third World.</p>
      <p>For the past century and during two world wars and various local conflicts, 
        the total number of victims of U.S. military actions has been 1.6 million 
        people – a third of what Communist China killed in its own land in only 
        half that time. In World War II, the U.S. killed 925,000 people on all 
        fronts, only half of what the Communists killed in Cambodia alone, less 
        than they killed in Tibet or — guess where else — Afghanistan. In Vietnam, 
        victims of the U.S. numbered 213,000 from 1960 to 1972. In Rwanda in 1994, 
        crowds driven by leftist agitators killed four times that number in only 
        10 weeks.</p>
      <p>In this context, when a leftist describes the U.S. as an aggressive and 
        military state, he is simply not being honest.</p>
      <p>Second: explain the attacks as acts of “fanaticism,” “war,” or “backwardness” 
        of the Islamic religion. Authors: pro-Western Christian, atheist, or Jewish 
        intellectuals – who are proud of what they see as superiority of their 
        respective countries, cultures, and religions.</p>
      <p>There is no single bellicose commandment in the Koran that is not also 
        present in the Old Testament. At least until the 20th Century, Muslim 
        invaders have always been more tolerant of religions in defeated lands 
        than Christians in India or in Africa, or than Israelis with the Cananeus 
        and Amorreus.</p>
      <p>The eminent Paul Johnson, in condemning the Muslims as having no history 
        of modernization as the West has had since the 16th Century, totally misses 
        the mark because these modernizing trends gave way to colonial absolutism 
        and later to totalitarian ideologies which gave birth to the age of terrorism 
        and genocide, two plagues which only later and through those ideologies 
        came to infect the Islamic population.</p>
      <p>This error is possibly the worst because it urges a general conflict 
        between Islam and the West, playing into the hands of anti-capitalist 
        forces – and Islamic forces, only in name – which subsidize and manipulate 
        Muslim extremists.</p>
      <p>Third: morally condemn the American reaction, using the excuse of “forgiveness.” 
        Authors: Pharisees, goody-goodies, terrorists dressed with cassok.</p>
      <p>No religion in the world gives anyone the right to “forgive” the offenses 
        of third-parties, against the will of victims or their descendants. The 
        forgiveness this people are talking about is the easy forgiveness  of 
        someone who has never suffered and has only to gain with somebody else’s 
        suffering.</p>
      <p>Making anti-American proselytism over a total contempt for the voice 
        of the victims is an unqualified low blow. For this reason, the ecumenical 
        cult “in favor of peace” gathered in Sao Paulo on the 23rd was a satanic 
        parody of the simultaneous celebration in Yankee Stadium. In the latter, 
        followers of all religions – including Islam – gathered together in an 
        act of gratitude and faithfulness, offering their lives in defense of 
        the country that has given them freedom. In the other, what we saw was 
        the word “forgiveness” blossomed into obscene disregard from the mouths 
        of individuals who, beneath their affectation of good sentiments, still 
        fume hate at the memory of the defeat suffered by their terrorist friends, 
        30 years ago, during military dictatorship. Any man who cannot forgive 
        the death of armed revolutionaries, but cynically wants the unarmed victims 
        to fraternize the murderers of their fathers, mothers and brothers, is 
        not and can never be a man of God.</p>
