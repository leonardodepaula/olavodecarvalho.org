      <p>Whenever I hear a left-wing politician condemn the capitalist greed in 
        prophetic voice, I wonder if he really fancies the craving for power to 
        be a passion which is morally superior to the wish for money, or if he 
        simply pretends to believe in that in order to play innocent. There is 
        evidently no third alternative. No left-wing activist would make a revolution 
        to just go home afterwards, living as an obscure common citizen of the 
        socialist republic &#151; each one of them is, by definition, the virtual 
        holder of a share of power in the upcoming State. This is, among the members 
        of a party, the only difference between an activist and a plain voter. 
        When taking up the revolutionary fight, one expects no less than a position 
        as commissioner of the people. After all, there would not be much sense 
        in giving less from oneself than what was given when taking up the responsibility 
        of active leader in the destruction of capitalism. (The same, of course, 
        can be applied, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, to the activists of fascism or 
        any other proposal of radical change of society. If I stress socialism, 
        it is for the simple reason that today in Brazil there is not a fascist-inspired 
        mass movement.)</p>
      <p>All revolutionary activism is therefore inseparable from the craving 
        for power, and it takes either a brutal shamelessness or a pathological 
        unconsciousness to prevent someone from realizing that such a passion 
        is infinitely more destructive than the wish for wealth. Wealth, no matter 
        how relative the abstractions of financiers may try to make it, always 
        has a residual materiality &#151; houses, food, clothes, implements &#151; 
        that makes it something concrete, a visible good worthy in itself, independently 
        from the surrounding opulence or misery. Power, on the other hand, as 
        Nietzsche well saw it, is nothing if it cannot be <i>more</i> power. This 
        is the most obvious thing in the world: mediated by social relationships 
        as it may be, wealth is ultimately domain over things. Power is domain 
        over men. A rich man does not become poor when his neighbours also get 
        rich. On the other hand, a power that eventually gets equalled by other 
        powers is automatically cancelled out. Wealth is developed by the adding 
        up of goods whereas power, essentially, does not increase so much by the 
        expansion of its means than by the suppression of other men's means of 
        action. In order to establish a police State, it is not necessary to provide 
        the police with additional guns &#151; it is enough to take them from 
        the citizens. A dictator does not become a dictator because he grants 
        himself new rights, but because he suppresses the old rights from the 
        people.</p>
      <p>The human intelligence would have to sink down to almost infranatural 
        levels before a philosophy &#151; or something similar to that &#151; 
        could come to invert such an evident equation, seeing in misery the foundation 
        of wealth and in political power the creative instrument of equality.</p>
      <p>The most characteristic phenomenon of the 20th century &#150; totalitarianism 
        &#150; was not a detour or a bump on the road to the democratic dream. 
        It was the inescapable consequence of a suicidal wager on the moral superiority 
        of political power and its equalitarian social mission. The outcome of 
        this wager is before everyone's eyes. The promised economic equality failed 
        to come about. However, the difference in terms of means of action between 
        those who govern and those who are governed has increased to a point of 
        which the most ambitious tyrants of Antiquity did not even dare to dream. 
        Julius Caesar, Attila or Genghis Khan would shun in horror if they were 
        offered the means to listen to every private conversation or to disarm 
        every adult man. Today, governments already study how to program the conduct 
        of future generations by genetic means. They are not satisfied with the 
        destructive power of demons: they want the creative power of gods.</p>
      <p>It is one of the most atrocious perversities of our time that a man imbued 
        with the simple desire to get rich is considered a morally harmful person 
        and almost a criminal, while an aspiring political leader is seen as a 
        beautiful example of idealism, kindness and love to one's neighbour. A 
        century who thinks that way is crying to heaven for a Hitler or a Stalin 
        to be sent down.</p>
