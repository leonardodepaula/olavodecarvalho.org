  <i>The New Age and the Cultural Revolution: Fritjof Capra &amp; Antonio Gramsci,</i> 
  Chapter I.<br>
  IAL and Stella Caymmi, Rio de Janeiro, 1993. (3<sup>rd</sup> edition)</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="2">Translated by Marcelo De Polli</font></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp; </p>
<p align="left">&#9;In early November,(1) Brazil will be receiving Mr. Fritjof 
  Capra, summoned by Bras&iacute;lia Holistic University (Universidade Hol&iacute;stica 
  de Bras&iacute;lia) to talk about the New Age, as heralded in his book <i>The 
  Turning Point. </i></p>
<p align="left"> <i>&#9;</i>Mr. Capra’s voice shall not be crying out in the desert. 
  The Holistic University has already assembled a congregation of local intellectuals 
  keen to say ‘amen’ to his lesson in church. Frei Betto and former Bras&iacute;lia 
  University dean Christovam Buarque can be found among the acolytes. We can see 
  that Mr. Capra is not a writer like the others: he’s a leader, a spiritual authority 
  and, let us admit it at once, a prophet.</p>
<p align="left">&#9;The content of his prophecies is all but unknown: <i>The Turning 
  Point </i>has found its way as far as the hands of children, who debate it at 
  school. However, according to the Holistic University this is hardly enough. 
  Mr. Capra must be heard by all akin to the human species. For, in spite of being 
  homonymous to a film director become famous on account of happy endings, he 
  guarantees a quite unhappy one to our century unless humanity should follow 
  his advice. Let us hurry to examine it with such urgency as the case requires.</p>
<p align="left">&#9;According to Mr. Capra, the history of the world has come 
  to a turning point, and must change its course. The three main changes on schedule 
  are the following: first, humanity will stop consuming fossil fuel (oil); second, 
  patriarchy will come to an end; third, the present scientific paradigm will 
  be replaced by a new one, a holistically based one. These three things are already 
  happening — so assures us Mr. Capra — yet the triple accomplishment must needs 
  be hastened; it will mark the coming of the New Age.</p>
<p align="left">&#9;While addressing the first item, Mr. Capra is very brief, 
  as becomes a prophet. Instead of the long analysis he dedicates to the other 
  two themes, he utters only the following prophetic words: ‘This decade will 
  be marked by the transition from the fossil fuelled to the new solar era, powered 
  by renewable energy straight from the sun.’ The decade Mr. Capra refers to ended 
  in 1990, his Good Book having been published in 1981. Well, not all prophets 
  are lucky. However, should the above-mentioned prophecy be four, five, or nine 
  years late, Mr. Capra can always claim St. John the Evangelist was not too accurate 
  concerning the date of the Apocalypse, either.</p>
<p align="left">&#9;Like so many other prophets, Mr. Capra may complain about 
  being misunderstood. I, for instance, do not understand how the world might 
  have leapt from the fossil fuel era straight into the solar energy one, without 
  going through the atomic era, in which we were at the time the prophecy was 
  uttered and in which we still are, after its expiration date. But perhaps Mr. 
  Capra’s prophetic intuition works at light speed, skipping steps. Which provides 
  us, by the way, with a good reason to skip right away to the next item, since 
  the first chapter of the ‘turning’ did not come to a happy ending.</p>
<p align="left">&#9;Patriarchy consists, according to Mr. Capra, of a complex 
  of three elements: one, the domination of women by men; two, the domination 
  over nature by the human species; three, the prevalence of reason (a masculine 
  faculty) over intuition (a feminine one). They are three sides of the one and 
  same phenomenon, summarized by Mr. Capra as the supremacy of <i>yang </i>over 
  <i>yin.</i></p>
<p align="left">&#9;It is, as can be seen, a special kind of patriarchy, a lot 
  different from the one to be found in History, or sociological treaties. For 
  they tell us that: the increase of technical power over nature shook the regime 
  of rural property which sustained patriarchy; and that the coming of the Empire 
  of Reason, brought along with the French Revolution, promoted equal rights for 
  men and women, striking the deathblow on the authority of the <i>pater familias. 
  </i>In short, they tell us that two out of the three things Mr. Capra gathers 
  under the common label of ‘patriarchy’ are precisely their opposite. But prophets 
  give little heed to profane sciences. <i>Non enim cogitationes meae cogitationes 
  vestrae</i>, as the Bible had already warned us. Mr. Capra does not think the 
  way we do, really.</p>
<p align="left">&#9;There is, however, something in him to which at least some 
  of us are allowed full understanding. Being logic, to his mind, an expression 
  of the abominable patriarchy whose end he craves, he couldn’t possibly obey 
  it without becoming, <i>ipso facto, </i>illogical. It is a matter of logic that 
  he should decide for being illogical. Any baby can understand this. The hard 
  thing is to understand it when one is no longer a baby. In order to get yourself 
  admitted into the heavens of the New Age, the reader must therefore become like 
  unto the little ones.</p>
<p align="left">&#9;Here is a typical case. To get rid of the hateful patriarchy, 
  says our prophet, humanity should seek inspiration in the example of the Chinese 
  civilisation, whose conception of human nature, set forth in the <i>I Ching,</i> 
  ‘is in blatant contrast with that of our patriarchal culture’. Now searching 
  for antipatriarchal ammunition amidst the pages of the <i>I Ching, </i>the reader 
  will find, on the hexagram no. 37, the following recommendations: ‘The wife 
  should always be guided by the will of the lord of the household, that is, by 
  the father, the husband or the adult son. She belongs in the house.’ Just the 
  kind of life Betty Friedan has asked God for. By the way, as we are told by 
  Marcel Granet on the classic <i>La Civilisation Chinoise,</i>(2)<i> </i>the 
  Chinese feudalism — the period during which most of the commentaries on the 
  <i>I Ching </i>were written — ‘rests over the acknowledgement of masculine prevalence.’ 
  The China which Mr. Capra refers to must not be the same one the profane geographers 
  know by the name.</p>
<p align="left">&#9;One thing we really cannot do is charge Mr. Capra with pro-chinese 
  factionalism. Why, if he rejects occidental logic, that doesn’t mean he bows 
  to the demands of the oriental one. According to him, <i>yang </i>represents 
  analytical reason, which divides, and <i>yin </i>represents intuition, which 
  unifies. The Chinese, not making much out of these subtleties, have represented 
  the divisive <i>yang </i>by a continuous trace, and the unifying <i>yin </i>by 
  one cut in half by a void. In the New Age, the editions of the <i>I Ching </i>will 
  appear duly corrected.</p>
<p align="left"> &#9;Meanwhile, as these editions do not come by, Mr. Capra is 
  already making on his own some more serious modifications in Chinese thought. 
  He says, for instance, that in Chinese civilisation man endeavours not to dominate 
  nature, but rather to integrate with it. Again, the Chinese wisdom of Mr. Capra 
  caught China unawares: a Chinese could hardly understand this sentence, if only 
  because they do not have a word meaning ‘nature’; not in the western sense of 
  this word, that is, signifying at the same time the visible world and the invisible 
  order which governs it — a double meaning the modern languages inherited from 
  the Greek <i>physis. </i>The Chinese language is, in this point, if you don’t 
  mind my saying so, more ‘analytical’: it has a term to designate the visible 
  world<i> (khien), </i>and another <i>(khouen) </i>to indicate the invisible 
  order. By way of compensation, the visible world or <i>khien</i> ‘synthetically’ 
  comprehends earthly nature as well as human society. Mr. Capra does not tell 
  us which one should man get reintegrated to; but of course no one could get 
  integrated into both, neither simultaneously nor in the same way. The ancient 
  Chinese have already warned us about it, and solved the contradiction by proposing 
  a duality of attitudes to match this double aspect of nature: the wise man, 
  says the <i>I Ching, </i>must <i>actively seek to</i> be integrated into the 
  invisible order or <i>khouen </i>(called ‘active perfection’ on that account) 
  and <i>softly get around </i>the demands of earthly nature (<i>khien </i>or 
  ‘passive perfection’). In other words, the wise man must be integrated <i>into 
  </i>the celestial order, by way of integrating <i>in</i> himself — thus dialectically 
  overcoming it — the earthly order. In this way the latter is absorbed into the 
  celestial order. ‘Celestial’ and ‘earthly’, in this sense, are respectively 
  identified to <i>dharma </i>and <i>kharma </i>in Hindu tradition. Man doesn’t 
  get ‘integrated’ into <i>kharma, </i>but rather ‘absorbs’ it, provided he is 
  integrated into <i>dharma: </i>he gets rid of the weight of the earth as long 
  as he heeds the celestial plea. Exactly the same sense in which Christianity 
  says that man overcomes natural need as long as he follows the paths of Providence. 
  Not quite what Mr. Capra says.</p>
<p align="left">&#9;The ideogram <i>Wang </i>(‘The Emperor’) sheds a further light 
  on this point. It constitutes, on its own, a compendium of Chinese cosmology. 
  It is made of three horizontal traces — Heaven above, Earth below, Man in the 
  middle, forming the triad <i>Tien-Ti-Jen, </i>‘Heaven-Earth-Man’ — cut by a 
  vertical trace, <i>Tao, </i>which is somewhat conventionally translated as Law 
  or Harmony. Harmony consists in each thing abiding where it belongs, in such 
  a way that, behind all changes the world goes through, the supreme order should 
  not be breached (even though, in this world of appearances, it necessarily is, 
  for, as the Gospels tell us, <i>‘it must needs be that offences come’</i>;<i> 
  </i>but in the end, all partial disorders are reintegrated into the total order).</p>
<p align="left">&#9;In the Chinese triad, man is called the ‘son of Heaven and 
  Earth’. The father being Heaven, we can see already, by the hexagram 37, who 
  is the one in command. Man therefore governs the sensible world, but he does 
  not do it out of his own will, but rather in the name of a transcendental order. 
  <i>Tien </i>does not mean ‘sky’ in the material sense, but rather ‘celestial 
  perfection’ or, more properly, ‘the will of Heaven’. The wise man or emperor 
  apprehends the will of Heaven from the invisible and sees to it on Earth. In 
  the central room of his palace, he daily attends to rites of complex geometrical 
  and numerological symbolism similar to that of pythagorism, by means of which 
  the celestial archetypes ‘descend’ — exactly like, in Holy Mass, it is said 
  that the Holy Ghost ‘descends’ — in order to bring order and harmony to Earth. 
  If the emperor stops performing these rites, Earth — society and nature at the 
  same time — enters a state of convulsion, and all about are spread ignorance, 
  fear, violence, hunger, plague.</p>
<p align="left">&#9;The interruption of the rites wasn’t all that could bring 
  on catastrophe. ‘The emperor’ — so writes Max Weber in <i>The Religion of China 
  </i>— ‘had to conduct himself according to the ethical imperatives of the classical 
  scriptures. The Chinese monarch remained, basically, a pontiff. He had to prove 
  he was actually the ‘son of Heaven’, the ruler approved of by the Heavens, so 
  that the people under his government should live well. Should the rivers burst 
  their dams, or the rain fail to come in spite of all rites, that was a proof 
  — expressly believed in — that the emperor didn’t have the charismatic qualities 
  required by Heaven.’</p>
<p align="left">&#9;Man rules the Earth, but in the name of Heaven. He rules as 
  <i>pontifex, </i>‘builder of bridges’; he connects Earth to Heaven through the 
  Straight Path, <i>Tao. </i>Should he stray away from the Straight Path, he would 
  lose sight of the Will of Heaven and could no longer rule but in his own name, 
  as a tyrant and usurper. Thus, in a re-entrance shock, he loses his power and 
  falls under the rule of the earthly powers he used to command. As the Earth 
  designates physical nature as well as human society, the shock could mean a 
  civil revolution or a military take-over, as well as a storm or earthquake. 
  The fallen monarch represents, by analogy, any man that, parting with the celestial 
  order, loses sight of his ideal destiny and falls prey of the abyssal passions. 
  Such is the situation described on hexagram 36, <i>Darkening of the Light:</i> 
  ‘Firstly he soared to Heaven, then he plunged deep into the Earth.’ The traditional 
  commentary, summarized by Richard Wilhelm, is the following: ‘The power of darkness 
  has mounted to such high a position that it may bring about damage to whomever 
  ranks with good and light. But in the end the power of darkness perishes by 
  his own obscurity.’</p>
<p align="left">&#9;One sees already that Mr. Capra’s advice, affected by the 
  double meaning of the word ‘nature’, may have two opposite meanings: by ‘getting 
  integrated’, does he intend that we obey the Will of Heaven or that we plunge 
  deep into the Earth? Whenever obscure, the prophets’ discourse deserve interpretation. 
  Let us interpret.</p>
<p align="left">&#9;In Mr. Capra’s version, Heaven is not mentioned. The triad 
  is thus reduced to a duality: on one side, man; on the other, visible nature. 
  Male and female. <i>Yang </i>and <i>yin. </i>To each is left the alternative 
  to subdue the other or ‘get integrated’ with it. The man of the industrial civilisation 
  has opted for the first hypothesis. Mr. Capra advocates the second.</p>
<p align="left">&#9;It is true what Mr. Capra says, that western civilisation 
  has opted for dominating nature. But it is also true that, since the Renaissance 
  at least, it has erased (just as Mr. Capra has) all reference to a transcendental 
  order (<i>Tien</i>) and left man by himself, face to face with material nature. 
  Since then, the history of western ideas has been marked by a pendular oscillation 
  between the ideologies of domination and the ideologies of submission: classicism 
  and romanticism, revolution and reaction, historicism and naturalism, scientism 
  and mysticism, promethean ativism and quietist evasionism, Marxism and existentialism 
  and, last not least, socialist cultural revolution <i>versus </i>‘New Age’ ideology.</p>
<p align="left">&#9;It is in this pair of opposites that resides the key for the 
  understanding of our prophet. Mr. Capra hits the nail on the head (no prophet 
  can accomplish the prodigy of being always wrong) when he says that his view 
  of cultural history is an alternative to Marxism. To Marx and his offspring, 
  nature is nothing but a background to human history. It is there, not as a <i>being, 
  </i>an ontological substance which man should contemplate and respect in its 
  objective constitution, but as raw material, owned and transformed by man at 
  will. Nature, in Marx, is <i>ancilla industriae. </i>Marxism carries on the 
  tradition of revolutionary prometheanism of the Renaissance, empowering it through 
  the utter and explicit submission of nature to History. That is what the New 
  Age is opposed to.</p>
<p align="left">It is not opposed, however, only to Marxism in general, but to 
  a specific form of Marxism, which wanted to operate a ‘turning’ as well, a U-turn 
  in the orientation of human thought. The founder of this Marxist current was 
  the Italian ideologist Antonio Gramsci (1891-1937). Gramscism proposes a cultural 
  revolution which subverts all admitted criteria of knowledge, setting up in 
  its place an ‘absolute historicism’, in which the function of intelligence and 
  culture is not to attain to objective truth anymore, but merely to ‘express’ 
  the collective belief, thus placed out of and above the distinction between 
  true and false. It is the utter submission of the ‘object’ (nature) to the ‘subject’ 
  (historic humanity). In this new paradigm, the emphasis of scientific activity 
  rests no longer on the objective knowledge of nature (exact description of its 
  visible appearance and investigation of the invisible principles which govern 
  it), but rather on its transformation through technique and industry, to which 
  corresponds, on the sphere of ideas, a kind of ‘permanent revolution’ of all 
  categories of thought succeeding one another in a vertiginous acceleration of 
  historical becoming.</p>
<p align="left">The ideology of the New Age stands out against this. To revolutionary 
  prometheanism, it opposes the ‘integration into nature’; to the acceleration 
  of History, the ‘ecological’ balance of the New World Order; and, to absolute 
  historicism, the ‘end of History’. Capra is inconceivable without Fukuyama. 
  Capra is the crust of which Fukuyama is the core. All the shiny ‘esoteric knowledge’ 
  of the New Age, with its secret initiations, its gurus, its magicians, and its 
  rites, are but the <i>exoteric</i> part, the external and social religious set-up. 
  Its interior, its ‘esoteric meaning’ is actually quite a modern, rational, and 
  profane science: strategical planning. Fukuyama is to Capra just as esoteric 
  knowledge is to exoteric knowledge, as the Church of John is to the Church of 
  Peter. But both, each in its own level and by its own means, fight the same 
  foe.</p>
<p align="left">Gramscism was a great success in the 60’s, inspiring the passing 
  fever of eurocommunism and reanimating some communist hopes. In Brazil, it took 
  over practically the whole Left, and PT(3) is essentially a Gramscian party, 
  whether it explicitly admits it or not. But the renovating intent was too little, 
  too late: communism ended up being defeated by the world-scale rising of the 
  ideology of the New Age. All in all, the blend of quantum physics and oriental 
  symbolisms, psychic experiences and free sex, peace promises and mirages of 
  self-accomplishment offered by this ideology is infinitely more seductive than 
  any ‘absolute historicism’. Brazil, late as always, is one of the few places 
  in the world where the fight still goes on, with a fierce nucleus of Gramscian 
  remainings offering a Quixote-like resistance to the triumphant armies of the 
  New Age.</p>
<p align="left">However, if the revolutionary prometheanism represented the utmost 
  <i>hybris, </i>the utmost dominating eagerness of man over nature, the ideology 
  of the New Age is no less than the re-entrance shock announced by the <i>I Ching.</i></p>
<p align="left">The New Age has defeated the Gramscian revolution. It was a teratomachy, 
  though: a combat of monsters. The Chinese would say it was a suicidal combat: 
  that, without the common obedience to <i>Tien, </i>the fight between <i>Ti </i>and 
  <i>Jen </i>can only reach an end through the ‘darkening of the light’. Therefore, 
  the victory of the New Age forebodes the next step of the cycle of changes: 
  humanity will fall from promethean self-glorification into helpless passivity; 
  it will ‘ecologically’ integrate with the balance of the New World Order, where 
  the collective sticking to the beaten track will be assured through a fair dealing 
  of the means to satisfy the basest passions and through an external mock religiosity 
  which will endow these passions with a flattering aura of ‘depth’ and ‘self-knowledge’.</p>
<p align="left">This can be psychoanalytically interpreted. G&eacute;rard Mendel, 
  on his book <i>La R&eacute;volte Contre le P&egrave;re, </i>one of the most 
  important contributions of the last decades to Freudian psychoanalysis, says 
  that, along history, the impulse of man to surpass the father has been, as intended 
  Freud, one of the most powerful driving forces of progress. But this impulse, 
  he goes on, may take one of two ways: man either surpasses and beats the <i>carnal 
  father </i>integrating himself with the rational order represented by the <i>ideal 
  father, </i>or sends to all devils the ideal order and, free from all moral 
  restraint, kills the carnal father and takes possession of the mother. This 
  last alternative is the promethean rebellion, the ‘integration’ of man into 
  darkness. Hence, according to Mendel, the anthropological as well as psychotherapeutical 
  importance of the words of the most celebrated Christian prayer: the ‘rebellion 
  against the father’ is wholesome and fruitful only when undertaken ‘in the name 
  of the Father’. In short: the carnal father is to the adult man (<i>Jen</i>) 
  nothing more than an aspect of <i>Ti, </i>Earth. He needs be put under the rule 
  of the celestial order, <i>Tien </i>or ideal father, if one is to be granted 
  the fair and harmonic government of the Earth, without usurpation or violence. 
  I have always thought there was something Chinese about dr. Freud.</p>
<p align="left">In Mendel’s terms, the Gramscian revolution is the destructive 
  rebellion against the father, and the ideology of the New Age, with its plea 
  for the fusion of all individual consciousness into a soup of holistic mirages, 
  is the ensuing regression to the womb. All regressions towards the womb are 
  announced by the exacerbation of fantasy, by the hypnotic calling of longings 
  deprived of all sense, by the mediumistic foresight of endless delight. They 
  all end in wretched slavery, in helpless passivity before the aggression of 
  the abyssal forces, in the darkening of light.</p>
<p align="left">It must needs be that offences come. The New Age has defeated 
  the Gramscian prometheanism, and make way: here comes hexagram no. 36. There’s 
  coming a shitstorm and Fritjof Capra is its prophet. But in the end, which is 
  not to be reckoned nigh, the power of darkness will succumb by force of its 
  own obscurity.</p>
<p align="left"></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">After the period of darkness, so assures us <i>Revelations, </i>the 
  madness of the new prophets who drew humanity into error will be brought out 
  to full daylight for all to see.</p>
<p align="left">As the New Age has barely begun, it is not time to do the complete 
  show. Meanwhile, not much can be done besides giving some preliminary samples 
  which attest to the generations to come the reality of a past which will seem 
  quite unlikely to them. As the wise Richard Hooker said, faced to the advance 
  of the puritan nonsense in the 16<sup>th</sup> century, when all this is through 
  ‘posterity will know that we did not let, through negligent silence, things 
  go by as in a dream’.</p>
<p align="left">Mr. Capra’s book is packed with samples. However, Justice determines 
  that we select them according to its degree of importance as given by the author 
  himself. We must then examine the third ‘turning point’: the revolution of the 
  scientific paradigm.</p>
<p align="left">In this field, Mr. Capra does not seem as impaired as in the Chinese 
  world, which he only knew through third-hand sources. A PhD in physics from 
  Vienna University, he cannot ignore the history of occidental science the way 
  he ignores the Chinese civilisation. But who said he cannot? To prophets everything 
  is possible.</p>
<p align="left">According to Mr. Capra, ‘the paradigm which is now in transformation 
  <i>has dominated our culture for many hundreds of years’</i>; he ‘understands 
  a certain number of ideas’ that ‘include the belief that the scientific method 
  is the only valid approach to knowledge; the conception of the universe as a 
  mechanical system composed of elementary material units’. These conceptions 
  bear the respective names of: scientism, mechanicalism, and social-Darwinism. 
  I repeat: according to Mr. Capra, they <i>dominate our culture since many hundreds 
  of years. </i>This suggests two questions. First: what is to ‘dominate a culture’? 
  Second: how much is ‘many hundreds’?</p>
<p align="left">We say that a certain idea dominates a culture when: firstly, 
  it is accredited by the most important intellectuals from every sector; secondly, 
  the competing ideas are no longer fertile, which means they no longer express 
  themselves into powerful and significant works, or have vanished entirely. Thus, 
  for example, Christianity dominated the Middle Ages because, on the one hand, 
  all of the philosophers and cultured men in general were Christians and, on 
  the other hand, the non-Christian currents of thought, even though they persistently 
  lived on in the collective subconscious, did not produce in this period any 
  work worthy of attention. We say that Marxism dominated the Soviet culture until 
  the 60’s because in this period no eminent intellectual in the USSR produced 
  any idea out of the conceptual frames of Marxism and because the non-Marxist 
  undercurrents (except in exile and in western languages) created nothing of 
  significant.</p>
<p align="left">In this strict sense, none of the three ideas which make up the 
  ‘dominant paradigm’ was ever dominant anywhere in the West. Since they appeared, 
  all three of them were unceasingly opposed to, fought, refuted, and rejected 
  in whole or in part by important intellectuals. On the other hand, openly hostile 
  currents to these ideas have remained fertile enough to produce some of the 
  most significant works in their respective fields.</p>
<p align="left">Let us see mechanicalism. This current was rejected from its birth 
  by giants such as Leibniz, Schelling, Vico, Schopenhauer, Driesch, Fechner, 
  Boutroux, Nietzsche, Weber, Kierkegaard, and many others, until it was stricken 
  down in the 20<sup>th</sup> century by Planck’s theory. How can it be ‘dominant’?</p>
<p align="left">Rigorously, mechanicalism was only dominant in a certain part 
  of the world, which for Mr. Capra is ‘the’ world: the Anglo-Saxon universitary 
  circles. That this traditionally presumptuous and self-assured little world 
  should become open nowadays to new ideas, that it should be willing to listen 
  to the Orientals without the traditional colonialist misunderstanding, is no 
  doubt good news. It is local news, though. There is not a more certain way to 
  make a people provincial than to persuade them that they are the centre of the 
  world. From this moment on, they will declare non-existent or irrelevant everything 
  placed out of their view, and when at length they discover something that all 
  the rest of the world already knew, they fashion it into a scientific revolution.</p>
<p align="left">As to scientism, so much has been written about it that it is 
  perfectly wrong to consider it dominant even in a toned down sense of the term. 
  To do so, it would be necessary to exclude at least Marxism, psychoanalysis, 
  phenomenology, neotomism, and existencialism from the foreground of culture. 
  Here, once again, Mr. Capra mistakes for worldwide dominant the opinion of a 
  restricted group.</p>
<p align="left">Social-Darwinism, in its turn, only became dominant as a public 
  belief in one single country in the world: the United States. It has never entered, 
  for instance, neither the communist countries nor the Islamic world; these add 
  up to almost two thirds of humanity. In the catholic countries, it was received 
  from the start as a perverted anomaly, raising reactions of scandal testified 
  by the social encyclicals of popes since at least Leo XIII.</p>
<p align="left">Still, in addition to affirming that these three beliefs ‘dominate 
  the world’, Mr. Capra assures us that this has been going on ‘since many hundreds 
  of years’. Let us tell the story.</p>
<p align="left">The eldest of the three is mechanicalism. Anticipated by Descartes, 
  it was fully formulated by Isaac Newton (<i>Mathematical Principles of Natural 
  Philosophy, </i>1687). However, it only became known by the European intellectuals 
  in general after 1738, when Voltaire published the lay-accessible <i>Elements 
  of Newton’s Philosophy.</i></p>
<p align="left">Not merely by means of scientific publicity did Voltaire promote 
  Newton’s victory. Newton’s opposer, G.-W. von Leibniz, was so insistently slandered 
  by Voltaire with tasteless ironies that the contemporaries ceased paying attention 
  to him. Leibniz was nearly discredited until the 20<sup>th</sup> century, when 
  the rediscovery of his ideas brought about prodigious advances in mathematics, 
  logic and the sciences of nature. Planck and Heisenberg’s new physics favoured 
  his ideas against Newton’s, substituting probabilism for mechanicalism. This 
  substitution could have occurred two centuries earlier, if Voltaire, emperor 
  of public opinion in the 18<sup>th</sup> century, had not woven a web of such 
  lasting prejudice about him. Ironically, Voltaire entered History as the enemy 
  of all obsolescence and prejudice.</p>
<p align="left">At any rate, Voltaire’s opinion did not exactly spread fast as 
  lightning. It took at least two or three decades to become a dominant belief 
  in the whole Europe. Around 1780, mechanicalism enjoyed an enviable prestige. 
  It can be said to be dominant since then, if ‘dominant’ does not mean unanimously 
  accepted, or accepted without reservations. The opposition moved against it 
  by Goethe’s and Driesch’s vitalism, Boutroux’s contingentialism and many other 
  currents until the deathblow struck by Planck and Heisenberg cannot be forgotten.</p>
<p align="left">At the moment Mr. Capra was writing <i>The Turning Point, </i>vitalism 
  was therefore completing <i>two </i>centuries of unceasingly contested glory 
  and swerving reign over the major factions of the academic world. This is a 
  great deal different from <i>a domain of many centuries over all the world.</i></p>
<p align="left">As to social-Darwinism, it is an offspring of biological Darwinism 
  and could not possibly have been born before its father. The principle of ‘survival 
  of the fittest’ came out at first as a biological theory and was only later 
  gradually transformed into an ideological evidence for the backward legitimisation 
  of capitalist competition.</p>
<p align="left"><i>The Origin of Species </i>was written in 1859. Herbert Spencer, 
  in his <i>First Principles, </i>published in 1862, widens the reach of evolutionary 
  ideas, fashioning them into a sociological principle. At the same time, occultists 
  such as Allan Kardec and Mme. Blavatsky grasp somewhat wildly the term ‘evolution’ 
  and give it a mystic sense, or mysticoid: the amphibians are no longer the only 
  ones who evolve into reptiles, and these into mammals; the disembodied souls 
  are the ones who, in the other world, evolve into ‘beings of light’, going up 
  on the cosmic scale while the apes descend from the trees. Clothed in a thousand 
  senses, the word ‘evolution’ is widespread, and the public debates appear, which 
  draw the intellectuals’ attention towards the political-ideological potential 
  of evolutionism. The debates reach a peak of success with Thomas Henry Huxley’s 
  conference, ‘Evolution and ethics’, in 1892. There lies, open, the path to the 
  legitimisation of liberal capitalism through the ‘survival of the fittest’. 
  The rest comes with Gustav Ratzenhofer’s (<i>Nature and Finality of Politics, 
  </i>1893) and William G. Sumner’s (<i>Folkways, </i>1906) books, which explicitly 
  set the foundations to the notion of ‘social evolution’, providing the capitalist 
  ideologists with the precious slogan they needed. Social-Darwinism is, then, 
  little more or little less than one century old. It was even less than that 
  at the moment Mr. Capra wrote his book.</p>
<p align="left">Finally, scientism. The formal and complete rejection, in the 
  name of science, of any philosophical or theological explanation of reality 
  whatsoever, was proposed for the first time by Auguste Comte (<i>Discourse on 
  the Positive Spirit, </i>1844). But Comte still reserved for philosophy the 
  task of synthesis and ordering of scientific knowledge, and Comte was only accepted 
  without disputation in one single place on this planet: in Brazil! (In 1914, 
  the positivist Alain attributed the world war to the fact that no other country 
  in the globe followed the example of Brazil, which had adopted positivism as 
  official doctrine of the state on the republican flag: <i>Order and Progress</i>(4) 
  is in fact a summary of Comtian philosophy. A formal and definitive scientistic 
  statement, along with the utter dismissal of every other form of knowledge as 
  void or insignificant, only came in 1934, with Rudolf Carnap, in <i>Logical 
  Syntax of Language. </i>But Carnap was no Voltaire, and could not count upon 
  the immediate approval of a vast public. The majority of the 20<sup>th</sup> 
  century philosophers categorically rejected scientism, which only dominated 
  over determined groups, especially in the Anglo-Saxon world. Contemporaneously 
  with Carnap’s statement, the mathematician and philosopher Edmund Husserl, founder 
  of <i>phenomenology </i>— the school that would later beget Heidegger, Scheler, 
  Hartmann, Sartre and Merleau-Ponty, among others —, delivered the celebrated 
  conferences at the University of Prague later put together in his <i>The Crisis 
  of the European Sciences. </i>In this book, he denied scientism from the base 
  up and from the inside out: the physical sciences, so he said, had lost their 
  essential scientific foundation and were no longer useful as a model of knowledge 
  of reality. Husserl was at least as influent as Carnap and still is, though 
  not as much in the Anglo-Saxon world which is the limit of Mr. Capra’s mental 
  horizon.</p>
<p align="left">In conclusion, scientism, which ‘dominates our culture since centuries’, 
  is completing sixty springs in this year of 1994. Furthermore, its first overt 
  manifestation was already three decades later than Max Planck’s first works, 
  whose indeterminism would become one of the bases of the ‘new paradigm’ whose 
  advent Mr. Capra has come now to announce us. The new paradigm is quite earlier 
  than the old one.</p>
<p align="left"></p>
<p align="left">Mr. Capra, as can be seen, does not understand much about the 
  subjects on which he exerts, to a crowd-like audience, a prophetic authority. 
  He has a distinguished lack of elementary information on Chinese cosmology, 
  which he says his vision of cultural history is based on, as well as on cultural 
  history itself, which he strives to fit forcefully into a preconceived model, 
  by means of gross generalisations and shameful alterations of chronology.</p>
<p align="left">I do not question, here, the validity of the holistic proposal 
  in general. I reserve myself the right to do it in another work. I simply believe 
  that it must have somehow better qualified supporters than Mr. Capra.</p>
<p align="left">My purpose has been to bear testimony of a fact of worldwide relevance, 
  which happens right in front of our eyes, and whose reality the forthcoming 
  generations will have the right to doubt. For, within reason and sense, it is 
  not plausible that thousands of respected intellectuals may accept and applaud 
  as a milestone in the history of thought a work like <i>The Turning Point, </i>which 
  does not even fulfil the minimum requisites of trustworthy information, authenticity 
  of the sources, and of conceptual rigour demanded from a thesis. Among so many 
  imperfections that a book can have, this one suffers from that single one which 
  cannot be tolerated by any means: <i>ignoratio elenchi, </i>the complete ignorance 
  of the subject. Mr. Capra defines his book, pretentiously, as <i>a new model 
  of cultural history </i>based on the <i>Chinese conceptions </i>of man and universe. 
  But he has not studied neither cultural history nor the Chinese conceptions 
  enough so that his opinion about them could have any objective importance whatsoever 
  out of his private circle of acquaintance. The content of his knowledge of the 
  subject is pure <i>lana caprina.</i></p>
<p align="left">The success of this book can only be explained by a factor completely 
  alien to its intrinsic value: its timeliness. It tells people what they wish 
  to hear, at the moment they wish. It offers a seducing perspective to a public 
  that asks to be seduced.</p>
<p align="left">That this public should include not only uncultured people but 
  prominent intellectuals as well, and that these should be ready to take in the 
  author’s promises without even requesting him the scientific credentials demanded 
  of a college student is really an implausible event.</p>
<p align="left">But, as Aristotle used to say, it is not really plausible that 
  everything should always go by in a plausible way. The implausible has happened. 
  It attests that, after centuries of iconoclastic rage against all beliefs of 
  the past and the values of other civilisations, the literate opinion of the 
  West has grown tired at last of being arrogant; but instead of an honest regret, 
  it is enacting a mocking conversion before us, which lays bare all the marks 
  of hysteriform pretending. Stunned by the sudden view of its own faults, it 
  renounced all critical precaution like one who repels a vice from the past; 
  and gave itself, helpless and sceptical, to the cult of the first idol who offered 
  it a promise of relief. It thinks or pretends to think that this idol is its 
  saviour. It is in fact its nemesis.</p>
<p align="left">It is not only the literate opinion of the West who is mistaken. 
  The prophet of mistake is himself likely to make mistakes. he fancies he brings 
  wisdom to the world, while what he brings is obscurity and confusion. He fancies 
  he brings a new prophecy, while what he brings is the fulfilling of an old curse.</p>
<p align="left"></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">I cannot finish these reflections about the prophet of the New 
  Age without making a prophecy myself: in the forthcoming centuries, when our 
  times can be looked at with some objectivity, the phenomenon of the New Age 
  will be considered an offence, a statement against human intelligence.</p>
<p align="left">Offences must forcefully come. Nothing can be done to avoid them. 
  I won’t even suggest, as Jesus did, that a millstone be hanged on their bearer, 
  and that he be drowned in the depth of the sea. For, as the hexagram 36 would 
  say, he is already down deep. All I can do is leave to posterity, if it ever 
  hears about these pages, a personal testimony of these obscure times: Not all, 
  not all believed in the false prophet.(5)</p>

    <li>I, having sent a copy of this chapter to Frei Betto before it was out 
      in a book, received from him a two-line answer, which is a most singular 
      psychological document. It goes like this: 'In spite of your reservations, 
      the event [Reception to Mr. Capra] was good for those who were there'. It 
      must have been really cool, I think. But the illustrious friar did not understand 
      me. It has never crossed my mind to devalue the event in itself - the organisation 
      of the programme, the sound system or the toppings of the crackers. What 
      I said is good for nothing is Mr. Capra's philosophy; it goes without saying 
      that celebrating it in a congress of intellectuals is as good as throwing 
      money in the dustbin. The better the event, the more regrettable the waste. 
      If by any means the sender intended to plead the quality of the event as 
      an argument in support of Mr. Capra, this would be like saying that the 
      price of the candle proves the quality of the corpse. Besides, what opinion 
      could we have of a thinker who argues in support of a philosophy by claiming 
      that it gives him the opportunity to go often to pleasant places? [Note
