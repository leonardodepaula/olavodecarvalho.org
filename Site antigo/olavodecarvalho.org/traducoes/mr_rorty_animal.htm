      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">&quot;Philosophy 
        originated from the attempt to escape to a world in which nothing changed. 
        Plato, who founded this field of culture we today call 'philosophy', believed 
        the difference between past and future to be minimal.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">Thus begins 
        the full-page article Mr. Richard Rorty published in Folha de S&atilde;o 
        Paulo<a name="r1"></a><sup><a href="#n1">1</a></sup> on March 3, 1994. 
        Well, when I started working on journalism, more than thirty years ago, 
        such a paragraph would be mercilessly cut off at the copydesk, who also 
        would not miss the opportunity to send the author a note such as follows: 
        &quot;But how, smarty boy, could Plato so anxiously desire to escape to 
        a world of changeless stability, since in this world itself he did not 
        see any big difference between past and future?&quot; Today, flagrant 
        nonsense like this is printed as a deep manifestation of philosophical 
        thought, and nobody from the copydesk is there to say that that is not 
        acceptable even as would-be journalism.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">Besides 
        starting his article with such obvious nonsense, Mr. Rorty intends yet 
        to use it as the basis for conclusions which constitute an assault on 
        the most elementary historical truths. So he continues: &quot;It was only 
        when they began to take history and time seriously that philosophers replaced 
        their desire to know another world with hopes for the future of this world. 
        The first attempt to consider time seriously was with Hegel&quot;.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">To begin 
        with, it is widely known that Plato, like all the Greek philosophers, 
        did see an immense difference between past and future: if the very fact 
        of change did not seem to him worthy of attention, he would not make any 
        effort to discover a changeless pattern behind the fleetingness of things. 
        Secondly, the preoccupation with &quot;the future of this world&quot; 
        was a strong characteristic of Plato's project, which was rather the work 
        of a social and political reformer than of pure contemplative theoretician.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">Thirdly, 
        to place in the philosophy of Hegel the beginning of the preoccupation 
        with History and time is to jump over two millennia of Christianity, a 
        religion which differentiated itself from the Greek understanding of the 
        world precisely because of its emphasis on the temporal and historical 
        character of human life - and this is already clear enough in St. Augustine.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">Fourth. 
        What is the reason for supposing there is a contradiction between a concern 
        with History and the desire for eternity, when it is precisely the inseparable 
        union of both these topics that constitutes the fundamental inspiration 
        of Hegel himself?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">Fifth. When 
        Mr. Rorty interprets the desire for eternity as an &quot;escape&quot; 
        or a fleeing, he's just doing a word game, and one that's easily reversible: 
        the impulse to revolutionise the world and accelerate historical change 
        can just as well be interpreted as a form of h&uuml;brys, of alienated 
        agitation, of relief valve before realities that are permanent and ineluctable, 
        such as death, physical frailty, the ignorance of our ultimate destiny 
        etc. These depreciative interpretations bear no more than a rhetorical 
        value, if they can do so much. To take them as an inquestionable given 
        is not an honest procedure.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">Grounded 
        on all these assumptions, Mr. Rorty finishes the article's opening paragraph 
        stating that &quot;the combined influence of Hegel and Darwin took philosophy 
        away from the question &quot;What are we?&quot; and brought it to &quot;What 
        can we become?&quot;. This pompous historical generalisation denies the 
        reader the information that, for Hegel, these two questions were rigorously 
        the same - &quot;Wesen is was gewesen ist&quot;. The Jena philosopher, 
        besides, was not distancing himself from Greek thought with it, but only 
        folowing the logical development of Aristotle's doctrine of <sup><a name="r2"></a><a href="#n2">2</a></sup>, 
        according to which the essence of a being is not its static form considered 
        in a given moment of time, but the purpose underlying in its development. 
        Mr. Rorty also leaves out that Darwin never said a word about &quot;what 
        we are&quot; or &quot;what can we become&quot;, but was only interested 
        in &quot;what we were&quot;; thus, he mistakes the theory of evolution 
        with evolutionist ideology, which is the work of Spencer and not of Darwin.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">In a single 
        paragraph, there are so many absurd implications that maybe it is the 
        very own compressive force of the falsehood rapidly injected in his brain 
        that makes the reader dizzy and incapable of realising he's before a cheap 
        impostor, disguised by the marketing as a philosopher.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">But I do 
        not believe Mr. Rorty writes likes this due to sheer stupidity. He knows 
        he's lying - and the secret behind the fascination he exerts over hordes 
        of pedant youths consists precisely in that, disbelieving any truth, they 
        envy the power of telling good lies. There's a lot people dreaming of 
        becoming Mr. Rorty when they grow up.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">But, do 
        you really want to know who this man is? Do you wish to have an idea of 
        how ridiculous it is to honour him as a philosopher? Going a little beyond 
        what he said in the newspaper, let's follow a brief examination of his 
        more general concepts.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">&quot;Language 
        is not an image of reality&quot;, assures Mr. Rorty, a pragmatist and 
        anti-Platonic philosopher. Should we interpret this sentence in the sense 
        Mr. Rorty calls 'Platonic', that is, as a denial of an attribute to one 
        substance? It would be contradictory: a language that is not an image 
        of reality cannot give us a real image of its relations with reality. 
        Therefore, the sentence must be interpreted pragmatically: it does not 
        affirm anything about language, but only indicates the intention to use 
        it in a certain way.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">The main 
        thesis of Mr. Rorty's thought is a declaration of intentions. The sentence 
        &quot;language is not an image of reality&quot; rigorously means this 
        and nothing else: &quot;I, Richard Rorty, am firmly decided to not use 
        language as an image of reality.&quot; It is the sort of unanswerable 
        argument: an expression of someone's will cannot be logically refuted. 
        Therefore, there is nothing to debate: keeping the limits of decency and 
        law, Mr. Rorty can use language as he may wish.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">The problem 
        appears when he begins to try to make us use language exactly like him. 
        He states that language is not a representation of reality, but rather 
        a set of tools invented by man in order to accomplish his desires. But 
        this is a false alternative. A man may well desire to use this tool to 
        represent reality. It seems that Plato desired precisely this. But Mr. 
        Rorty denies that men have other desires than seeking pleasure and avoiding 
        pain. That some declare to desire something else must be very painful 
        to him, for, on the contrary, there would be no pragmatically valid explanation 
        for the effort he puts in changing the conversation. Given the impossibility 
        to deny that these people exist, the pragmatist will perhaps say that 
        those who look for representing reality are moved by the desire to avoid 
        pain as much as those who prefer to create fantasies; but this objection 
        will have shown precisely that these are not things which exclude each 
        other. The Rortyan alternative is false in its own terms.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">In the face 
        of such a painful realisation, Mr. Rorty claims that his philosophy consists 
        in the proposal of a new vocabulary, in which the differences between 
        absolute and relative, natural and artificial, true and false, will be 
        abolished. He acknowledges having no argument to offer in defence of his 
        proposal, since it, &quot;not being able to be expressed in Platonic terminology&quot;, 
        is above, or below, the possibility of being proved or refuted. &quot;Therefore&quot;, 
        he concludes in the name of all pragmatists, &quot;our efforts of persuasion 
        take the form of a gradual inculcation of new ways of speaking.&quot; 
        Mr. Rorty, therefore, does not intend to convince us of the truth of his 
        ideas: he only intends to &quot;gradually inculcate&quot; in us his way 
        of speaking; which, once adopted, will make us gradually forget to ask 
        if what is said is true or false. But, to gradually inculcate in others 
        a linguistic habit, while at the same time putting it beyond the reach 
        of any rational arbitration, is sheer psychological manipulation. We leave, 
        therefore, the field of philosophical discussion - which Rortyanism rejects 
        as &quot;Platonic&quot; - to enter the field of the subtle imposition 
        of wills achieved through the repetition of slogans and the change of 
        vocabulary. It is what George Orwell has called Newspeak in his novel 
        1984.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">This is 
        perhaps the deep and secret reason why, after saying that men are nothing 
        but animals in search of pleasure, and reducing language to an instrument 
        for the domination of weak animals by the strong ones, Mr. Rorty still 
        can declare that &quot;we, pragmatists, do not behave like animals&quot;, 
        when his words seemed to indicate the exact opposite. The truth is that 
        they are, actually, animal trainers. A man who trains horses does not 
        argue with them: he just makes use of psychological influence in order 
        to &quot;gradually inculcate&quot; in them the habits he desires them 
        to have.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">Like all 
        trainers, pragmatists are driven by pious intentions: &quot;What matters 
        to us s to create means of diminishing human suffering.&quot; It is with 
        such a noble goal the Mr. Rorty proposes the abolition of the oppositions 
        between false and true, real and apparent, absolute and relative etc., 
        which have been causing great distress to philosophy students, and suggests 
        the universal adoption of the Newspeak.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">Once such 
        a measure is approved, philosophical debates will cease to be as they 
        used to, that is, an uncomfortable clash of arguments and proofs, to become 
        an effort to make all the more pleasurable and pain-free the gradual inculcation 
        of new habits in the minds of the audience. New theories will not anymore 
        call to their help the heavy weapons of logic, but rather the delicate 
        instruments of marketing, giving out free gifts to new followers, and 
        putting smiling Playboy bunnies in the cover of academic works.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">But Mr. 
        Rorty's decisive contribution to the relief of human suffering is his 
        fierce combat against the idea that life may have a meaning. It is understandable 
        that, in a meaningful universe, Mr. Rorty feels very bad - an outsider, 
        a stranger, just like a non-pragmatist would feel in a meaningless world. 
        However, Mr. Rorty sees no use in arguing with those who do not feel like 
        him. The controversy over the existence or non-existence of a meaning 
        intrinsic to the universe, as he says, &quot;is way too radical to be 
        judged from a neutral point of view&quot;. There is no way to argue: all 
        that a man can do is to express his desires. Therefore, once again, Mr. 
        Rorty's thesis is a declaration of intentions: he Richard Rorty, will 
        do everything within his power in order to guarantee that life makes no 
        sense whatsoever. And he does that, by the way, with great zeal and competence. 
        There are those who believe that it is the lack of meaning that makes 
        human beings unhappy , but Mr Rorty just couldn't care less. He defends 
        democratic pluralism, the expression of all points of view.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">Yet, the 
        confrontation of points of view, unable to be arbitrated by any intellectually 
        valid means, becomes a mere competition between desires, which will have 
        as winner the party with the greatest ability to manipulate.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">Those who 
        know Mr. Rorty personally guarantee he is a really nice person. I believe 
        that. But I doubt he wags his tail. After all, he's not the animal in 
        the story<a name="r3"></a><a href="#n3"><sup>3</sup></a>.</font></p>

        Translator's note: Folha de S&atilde;o Paulo is the best-selling Brazilian 
        newspaper, even though it is read by the 'elite' of the country. We can 
        say that it similar, in tone and ideas, to The New York Times and the 
        other big liberal newspapers.</font></p>

        A case in point: Viktor Frankl, the never enough praised Jewish psychiatrist 
        who, inside the hell of nazi concentration camps, found out that the meaning 
        of life is more necessary to man than freedom itself. Frankl said to an 
        American audience: &quot;It was not just some Berlin ministries that invented 
        the gas chambers of Maidanek, Auschwitz and Treblinka: they were prepared 
        in the offices and classrooms of scientists and nihilistic philosophers, 
        among which were and are some Nobel-laureate Anglo-Saxon thinkers. It's 
        just that, if human life is nothing but an insignificant by-product of 
        some protein molecules, little does it matter whether a psychopath be 
        eliminated as useless, and that to the psychopath a few inferior people 
        are added: all this amounts to nothing else logical and consequent reasoning.&quot;

        Re-reading the proof sheets of this chapter, it occurred to me reminding 
        the reader that a proposal like Mr Rorty's contains in itself, together 
        with the refusal of rational proof, a crowd f antibodies against any attempt 
        to refute it in the serenity of an academic discussion. &quot;Gradual 
        inculcation&quot; never comes face to face with arguments, but takes advantage 
        of the reader/listener's moments of distraction to surreptitiously induce 
        in him a mood change. Its modus argumentandi is neither the philosopher's 
        nor even the rhetorician's, but that of the neurolinguistic programmer: 
        it works below the threshold of conscience, after inducing the victim 
        to relax its defences by means of nice conversation. Against this kind 
        of action, the only possible defence is to face the enemy in the field 
        he has chosen: that of psychological action. It is not the case, therefore, 
        of arguing, but of unmasking, as in psychoanalysis. During Mr. Rorty's 
        stay in Brazil, I was shocked at his audience's inability to perceive 
        the difference between argumentation and seduction: since Mr. Rorty himself 
        admits there is no use in arguing, what could his apparent arguments be 
        but a diversionist manoeuvre, a trompe l'oeil aimed at entertaining conscious 
        attention while below and beyond any critical supervision, the gradual 
        inculcator discretely manipulates the depths of the distracted audience's 
        souls? But, what small-town girl would be foolish enough to try to rid 
        herself of a seducer using polite sentences that would only lengthen the 
        conversation? In order to repel the seducer it is necessary to definitely 
        refuse him any sign of sympathy from the very beginning. These days, many 
        are the trends of opinion that prefer psychological influence to logical 
        argumentation. They do not try to conquer our adhesion, but to monopolise 
        our attention. Extending a conversation which even they do not acknowledge 
        as leading to any intellectually valid results, they gradually involve 
        us in its atmosphere, so that without ever having explicitly agreed with 
        them, we suddenly find ourselves speaking their language, judging by their 
        values, acting according to their rules. Thus they obtain, above or below 
        our superficial disagreement, our most complete obedience. There is no 
        way to oppose them but with overt manifestations of antipathy, so that 
        they grasp that what separates us from them is not just some intellectual 
        disagreement, but also an absolute moral rejection; that, in short, we 
        don't like their conversation. The tone of the present book [chapter] 
        has therefore a prophylactic meaning.</font></p>
