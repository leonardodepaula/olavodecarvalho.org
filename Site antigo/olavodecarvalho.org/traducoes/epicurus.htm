      <p align="left"><b>§16. <i>Epicurus and Marx</i></b></p>
      <p align="left">&#9;Epicurus inverts, as seen on § 10, the logical relationship 
        between practice and theory. If normally theory is the logical basis of 
        practice and if the latter is the exemplification of the first in the 
        level of facts, in Epicureanism practice is what produces the psychological 
        conditions which will make the theory believable, and the theoretical 
        discourse will be nothing but the discursive element of practice, the 
        translation into speech of the belief produced by habit. The Epicurean 
        theory does not describe the perceived world, but its practice alters, 
        by way of exercises, the perception of the world so that it becomes similar 
        to the theory. The point is not to understand the world, but to transform 
        it.</p>
      <p align="left">&#9;It is likely that the reader will have recognised the 
        last sentence: it is Karl Marx's <i>11<sup>th</sup> Thesis on Feuerbach</i>. 
        Everything leads us to believe that the time Marx devoted to the study 
        of the philosophy of Epicurus – the subject of his doctoral thesis – has 
        left on the final version of Marxism much deeper traces than what is generally 
        supposed by scholars and the mature Karl Marx would like to let show. 
        The Marxist symbiosis of theory and practice does not come from Hegel 
        – it is actually an Epicurean inheritance. However, what happens is that 
        this symbiosis, abolishing the normal distance between the plane of action 
        and that of speculation, suppresses, in both Marxist and Epicurean Philosophy, 
        the difference between the actual and the possible, precipitating us into 
        a hallucinatory crisis where the theoretical detachment which is the foundation 
        of the very notion of objective truth<sup><a name="1" href=#nota1>1</a></sup> 
        disappears. The desire, the impetus, the ambition – either of the individual 
        soul or of the revolutionary masses – becomes the sole foundation of a 
        world vision in which theory has no purpose, except as a rhetoric stimulant 
        of practical action, or, once any given action has been taken, to endorse 
        whatever resulted from it. Even if the effects of any such action are 
        quite different from what had been expected, there will not be enough 
        critical detachment to appreciate them, and they will not only be accepted 
        but also celebrated as normal and desirable: theory here has no independent 
        value, being reduced to an <i>a posteriori</i> rationalisation, to a praise 
        of the irrevocable facts. The capacity of the world’s left to justify 
        the worst atrocities of the communism regime in the name of a humanitarian 
        utopia – and, after the end of communism in the USSR, to go on preaching 
        socialist ideals as if there were no intrinsic relationship between them 
        and what happened in the Soviet inferno – is a morbid inheritance that 
        came from Epicureanism through Marx. It is no surprise that the outcome 
        of the evolution of a century of Marxist thought was Antonio Gramsci, 
        the theorist of &quot;absolute historicism&quot;, who clearly states what 
        in Marx was only implicit and insinuated: the elimination of the concept 
        of objective truth and the submission of every cognitive activity to the 
        goals and criteria of the revolutionary <i>praxis</i>; the absorption 
        of logic on rhetoric, and of science on ideological propaganda<sup><a name="2" href=#nota2>2</a></sup>. 
        It is also understandable that in another parallel line of this evolution, 
        leading to Reich and Marcuse, erotic desire and not the force of objective 
        economic causes be the true engine of progress and revolution. These developments 
        disclose to the light of day tendencies which were already latent as traces 
        from his Epicurean origins. The fact that they have risen again through 
        the evolution of Marxism shows that Marx knew how to tread them down, 
        but not how to overcome them. In vain, Marxist thinkers like Luk&aacute;cs 
        or Horkheimer, who were more in tune with the classical traditions of 
        the West and anxious to include Marx in the Canon, protested against the 
        invasion of irrationalism which, mainly from the 60’s on, ended up contaminating 
        all of the world’s left: as Dr. Freud would say, the rejected past returns 
        with double the strength<sup><a name="3" href=#nota3>3</a></sup>.</p>
      <p align="left">&#9;Marxism and Epicureanism seem to go in opposite directions: 
        the latter flees from the world in order to remain shut up in the garden 
        with the elected ones, whereas the first reaches out to the collective 
        action which will transform the world. But the difference is rather one 
        of scale than of nature: in both cases, we are talking about enveloping 
        human beings in an all-absorbing and hypnotic <i>praxis</i>, which will 
        forever safeguard them from the temptation of objectivity, leaving no 
        space for theoretical detachment and imprisoning all intellectual energies 
        in a closed circuit of rhetorical self-persuasion. The point is to neutralise 
        human intelligence, to make it run after utopian goals which, by way of 
        an infernal dialectics that transfigures every defeat in a sign of close 
        victory, will absorb it the more completely as the actual achievements 
        fall short of the dreamed finalities. Only this can explain the phenomenon 
        of thousands of intellectuals who have refused, through a whole century, 
        to see the evils of communism, or, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, 
        to acknowledge any relationship between these evils and the socialist 
        ideal. Truly, is it not the effect of a peculiar scotoma that leftist 
        intellectuals see in any movement of the right, however small, the signs 
        of nazi-fascist insurrection and, on the other hand, that they believe 
        the socialist ideal to have immaculately emerged from the Gulag? Is it 
        not strangely morbid that the ideology which reduces the actions of individuals 
        to the mere expression of deep ideological biases explains the sixty million 
        victims of Stalin as the result of one man’s accidental evilness, with 
        no root at all in the ideology he professed? That the intransigent defenders 
        of the concept of society as a substantial whole, as an organic block 
        in which ideology and practice are inherently bounded, explain the crimes 
        of the Soviet government as accidental deviations completely alien to 
        Marxist ideology? Is it not something really sick the obstinacy in keeping 
        Karl Marx’s figure – or Lenin’s – free from any contamination with the 
        crimes of the Soviet dictatorship, when even Christ himself was held responsible 
        for the cruelties of the Inquisition? Is it not odd that, after all that 
        was revealed about the communist tyranny, socialism still be a respectable 
        ideal, whereas crimes on a much lesser scale have been enough to blood-stain 
        forever the image of Italian and Spanish fascism, or of Latin-American 
        dictatorships? Finally, is it not an intellectual anomaly that the philosophy 
        which most emphasised the social and historical rooting of abstract concepts 
        – condemning as &quot;metaphysics&quot; any acknowledgement of non-historical 
        or supra-historical evidence – now try to present socialism as an essence 
        most pure, uncontaminated by one whole century of communist experiment? 
        How to explain the obstinate blindness of philosophers, of intellectuals, 
        of artists, among which can be found some of the most remarkable people 
        of this century, if not through the amazing <i>illusionist power</i> that 
        is inherent to the very root of Marxism, through its almost diabolical 
        ability to transfigure the appearance of things, leading people to see 
        things different from what they are?</p>
      <p align="left">&#9;Marx had, personally, a tremendous sense of drama, of 
        pretending, of prestidigitation; this has been established by his biographers 
        accurately enough<sup><a name="4" href=#nota4>4</a></sup>. But that alone 
        cannot endow his philosophy with such power to elude consciousness. However, 
        once we point that the first interest of the young Marx was on the prince 
        of philosophical illusionists, and, following that, we find in both Epicurus 
        and Marx the premeditated and hallucinating confusion of theory in practice 
        and practice in theory to be identical, then we realise the inexhaustible 
        virulence of the Epicurean heritage, resisting through the millennia and 
        reviving at every new cyclical effort to establish somewhere the kingdom 
        of imposture.</p>

      <p align="left">On &quot;11<sup>th</sup> Thesis on Feuerbach&quot;<sup><a name="5" href=#nota5>5</a></sup>, 
        Marx says that:</p>
      <p align="left">&#9;&quot;The philosophers have only <i>interpreted</i> 
        the world, in various ways; the point is to <i>change</i> it.&quot; </p>
      <p align="left">&#9;1. To whom is this summons directed? If Marx is reporting 
        himself, in this thesis, to the traditional concepts of <i>theoria</i> 
        and <i>praxis</i>, we must admit that, truly, philosophers have always 
        busied themselves with the interpretation of the world, with the making 
        of theories, because they thought it to be their specific job, that which 
        distinguished them from other men, who in their turn were involved with 
        <i>praxis</i> and had no interest on <i>theoria</i>, or on the contemplation 
        of truth. In adopting the attitude which was contrary to that of most 
        men, philosophers were a dialectic counterweight of <i>praxis</i>: contemplative 
        life opposed itself to active life. Well, if non-philosophers have always 
        been busy transforming the world while the philosopher was contemplating 
        and interpreting it, what sense would it make in summoning them to a <i>praxis</i> 
        in which they have been involved by immemorial habit, and which they never 
        thought of abandoning? Such cannot be the meaning of Marx’s thesis. His 
        summons is not directed to men <i>in general</i>, taken indiscriminately, 
        much less to the men of <i>praxis</i>, but specifically to <i>philosophers</i>. 
        They were the ones who have been busy only with the interpretation of 
        the world. Therefore, it is them who must be summoned to a change of attitude. 
        The <i>11<sup>th</sup> Thesis on Feuerbach</i> proposes, essentially, 
        a change in the attitude of the <i>philosopher</i> as such. It is not 
        the establishment of a new <i>praxis</i>, but a new kind of <i>theoria</i>, 
        which, in its turn, consists of <i>praxis</i>.</p>
      <p align="left">&#9;2. In order to understand in what consists this change, 
        we have to understand the former attitude. In what consists the <i>interpretative</i> 
        attitude which Marx opposes to the transforming attitude? Since <i>theoria 
        </i>and <i>praxis</i> are classical concepts of Greek philosophy, we must 
        turn ourselves to it. (It is true that the term <i>praxis</i> has, in 
        Marxism, a different and specific meaning, but that makes no difference, 
        for if the Greek philosophers Marx had in mind made <i>theoria</i>, as 
        opposed to <i>praxis</i>, we cannot presume they possibly had in mind 
        the Marxist understanding of the word <i>praxis</i>, but rather the Greek 
        understanding.)</p>
      <p align="left">&#9;In Greek philosophy, the word <i>theoria</i> had a precise 
        meaning. It was related to the notions of <i>logos</i> (&quot;reason&quot; 
        or &quot;language&quot;), of <i>eidos</i> (&quot;idea&quot; or &quot;essence&quot;), 
        of <i>&oacute;n</i> (&quot;patency&quot;, &quot;unveiling&quot;, &quot;disclosing 
        of the occult truth&quot;.)</p>
      <p align="left">&#9;The theoretical man, the philosopher, did not spend 
        his time with contemplation in the general sense, with looking in the 
        sense that other men could, them too, contemplate and look. As an example, 
        all men contemplated theatre shows, the beauty of human beings and of 
        the landscape etc. The common man’s contemplation could have amusement, 
        aesthetic, utilitarian or whatever purposes. But not the philosopher’s. 
        It was a very specific kind of contemplation, one that had a specific 
        motivation and a specific goal, which made it a precisely <i>philosophical</i> 
        contemplation and nothing else. The philosopher would contemplate things 
        in order to grasp their essence (<i>eidos</i>), making patent (<i>aletheia</i>) 
        their true being (<i>&oacute;n</i>); after that, the philosopher stated 
        <i>(logos</i>) what this thing was, making patent (<i>aletheia</i>) the 
        true being (<i>&oacute;n</i>) which was hidden.</p>
      <p align="left">&#9;To put it in another way, to the philosopher, phenomena 
        were signs which he deciphered in search of the meaning or essence. From 
        sign to meaning, the interpretative key was reason or <i>logos</i>. Through 
        reason, the philosopher could jump from a level to another: from the level 
        of unstable, deceiving phenomena to the level of essences, of true being. 
        This level was considered to be <i>superior</i>, for it comprised and 
        surpassed the world of phenomena (it contains all manifest phenomena, 
        plus numberless non-manifest essences or possibilities), besides being 
        stable, immutable, and eternal. This attitude became more defined and 
        self-conscious from the time of Platonism, but it was already the attitude 
        of the Eleatic philosophers. It is an attitude based altogether on the 
        belief that all facts and all beings are phenomena – &quot;appearances&quot; 
        – <i>of</i> something: they are exteriorisations or exemplifications of 
        essences or possibilities eternally contained in the Divine Intelligence. 
        The Greek Philosopher contemplated things, therefore, <i>sub specie &aelig;ternitatis</i>, 
        that is, in the category of eternity, under the light of eternity; he 
        looked for their eternal meaning above their transitory and phenomenic 
        appearance. This contemplation therefore bestowed on things a superior 
        dignity and reality and a superior ontological consistence. As regards 
        the ends of this analysis, the difference between Platonism and Aristotelism 
        is of lesser importance. For Plato, essences constituted a separated and 
        transcendent world; for Aristotle, the intelligible core was immanent 
        to the sensible world; however, in both cases there is a passage from 
        immediate phenomena to a more permanent and deep layer.</p>
      <p align="left">&#9;The interpretation (<i>hermeneia</i>) of appearances 
        consisted on this rise on the ontological level, from the phenomenic being 
        up to the essential being. The term <i>hermeneia</i> derives from the 
        name of the god Hermes, or Mercury, the god <i>psicopompo</i>, that is, 
        "guide of the souls", whose duty was taking them up and down through the 
        worlds or planes of reality, from the sensible to the intelligible, from 
        the particular, transitory and apparent to the universal and stable. On 
        this consisted, basically, the <i>interpretative</i> attitude of the Greek 
        philosopher.</p>
      <p align="left">&#9;3. What is the essential difference between the contemplating 
        or interpretative attitude and the transforming attitude, that is, what 
        is the essential difference between <i>theoria</i> and <i>praxis</i>?</p>
      <p align="left">&#9;3.1. <i>Theoria</i>, in elevating the object to the 
        level of its idea, essence, or archetype, catches the set of possibilities 
        of which this object is the particular and concrete manifestation. As 
        a case in point, the archetype of &quot;horse&quot;, the possibility of 
        &quot;horse&quot;, can manifest itself through black, speckled, Arab, 
        percherons or quarter horses, in horses we may ride for our sport and 
        horses that help us doing some work. It can manifest itself in prosaic 
        cart horses or in famous, almost-personalised horses like that of Alexander 
        the Great. It can manifest itself in mythical beings which &quot;participate 
        in horsehood&quot;, like Pegasus or the unicorn, each one bearing in its 
        own turn a set of symbolic intentions and significations. Finally, reason, 
        upon investigating the being of the object, elevates the latter up to 
        its ultimate nucleus of possibilities, rescuing it from its empirical 
        accidentality, and restoring, so to speak, its &quot;eternal&quot; sense. 
        The &quot;practical&quot; consequence that comes from it is portentous. 
        In knowing an archetype, I not only know what the something is, both actually 
        and empirically, but everything that it <i>can be</i>, all the latency 
        of possibilities it can manifest and is insinuated behind its particular 
        manifestation, located in space and time.</p>
      <p align="left">&#9;<i>Praxis</i>, on the contrary, transforms the object, 
        that is, <i>it actualises one of the possibilities, causing all the others 
        to be immediately excluded</i>. Let us take an example – say, a tree. 
        If I investigate the object &quot;tree&quot; in order to attain to its 
        archetype, I become conscious of what &quot;tree&quot; is, of what it 
        could be, of what it can mean to me and to others, I can look at it on 
        different planes of reality etc. But, <i>if I transform the tree in a 
        chair, it no longer can be transformed in table or in wardrobe</i>, much 
        less in a tree. From chair, it can only be transformed in an old chair, 
        and after that, in trash.</p>
      <p align="left">&#9;3.2 The philosopher, therefore, takes the immediate 
        sensible appearance as a sign or as a symbol of a being. To the <i>praxis</i> 
        man, however, the appearance of things is always the <i>raw material </i>for 
        the desired transformations. Theoretical investigation considers a being 
        in the set of possibilities that contain it, explaining and integrating 
        it in the total sense of reality. <i>Praxis</i>, on the other hand, limits 
        its possibilities by irrevocably actualising one of them. For <i>theoria</i>, 
        a being is above all its <i>form</i> in the Aristotelian sense, that is, 
        that which makes it what it is; whereas for <i>praxis</i> a being is above 
        all <i>matter</i>, that is, that which allows it to become something which 
        it is not. This opposition must not be mistaken for that of the &quot;static&quot; 
        and the &quot;dynamic&quot;, because internal dynamic is part of the form 
        – e.g. the form of a seed is the complete plant which the seed is able 
        to become. To put it more correctly, we can say that <i>theoria</i> is 
        concerned with what a being is in itself and by itself, and <i>praxis</i> 
        is concerned with what it is <i>not</i>, in the secondary being, and sometimes 
        in the false being or parody of being that can be produced from it. It 
        was on this perspective that the Hindu doctrines denied that action could 
        bring any knowledge of any kind. Action produces only transformation, 
        a flow of impressions, illusion, which we can leave only through posterior 
        reflexive detachment, through theoretical and critical &quot;denial&quot; 
        of the consummated action: the philosophic soul, a latent potency in <i>homo 
        sapiens</i>, only is actualised as a reflection over the delusions of 
        the <i>homo faber</i><sup><a name="6" href=#nota6>6</a></sup>.</p>
      <p align="left">3.3 Should <i>praxis</i> require any theory, such theory 
        will not consider the nature of a being, and will not attempt to make 
        an investigation of what place a being occupies in the total body of reality, 
        but rather only in what it can be transformed in the next moment, not 
        by its own internal dynamic, but by force of human intervention. Such 
        theory will not be a <i>theory of the object</i>, but a <i>theory of the 
        action</i> the object may suffer. It is not a <i>theory of being</i>, 
        but a <i>theory of praxis</i>. Since <i>praxis </i>is always human action, 
        then every object will <i>always be considered under only one category: 
        the category of passion</i>, that is, of the transforming actions it may 
        suffer. The point is no more to understand what is a horse or a tree, 
        or their place in reality, but rather what <i>I</i> can do, within my 
        own personal range of interests, with the tree or the horse, independently 
        of what they are. I can, as case in point, burn the tree or eat the horse: 
        if theory respected the ontological and even physical integrity of the 
        object, <i>praxis</i> begins by denying it, that is, by not admitting 
        that the object is what it is and by demanding that it be transformed 
        in <i>something else</i>: it does not interpret, but it transforms.</p>
      <p align="left">3.4 It should be evident that the case here is not to condemn 
        <i>praxis</i> over some utopian contemplative life, but only to restore 
        the sense of a hierarchy of values that seems to be inherent to the structure 
        of any sane human individual. The transforming <i>praxis</i> concerns 
        essentially the means: since every transformation is intended to produce 
        some result or end, the object submitted to it is always and necessarily 
        a means and only a means. It is a means or an instrument the land which 
        man works, and so are means and instruments the sheep he feeds and kills 
        and the tree he throws down. Work is a means and an instrument, as well 
        as capital. Whatever is a means or an instrument is worth nothing by itself 
        but only by something else: the means or instrument is an intermediary, 
        a transition or a passage, something that will be left at a certain point 
        and surrender its place to the ends. Man’s universal tendency to save 
        effort testifies to the subjection of the means to the ends.</p>
      <p align="left">&#9;Inversely, something which is an end, something that 
        is worth in itself, cannot be the object of transforming <i>praxis</i>, 
        but of contemplation and love. As Miguel de Unamuno used to say, &quot;the 
        car is useful because I can use it to go to the house of my beloved; but 
        what’s the usefulness of my beloved?&quot;. I may, of course, lower her 
        to a means or an instrument of my pleasure, but on that case I no longer 
        have any love for her, but for pleasure in itself<sup><a name="7" href=#nota7>7</a></sup>. 
        The loved object, if it is truly loved, is not a means, but an end. We 
        do not desire to change it, to transform it or to use it for some other 
        purpose, but we desire rather to enjoy its presence without causing it 
        any alteration, without changing it in the slightest detail<sup><a name="8" href=#nota8>8</a></sup>. 
        On the contrary, in contemplating and in loving it is us who transform 
        ourselves: &quot;The lover is transformed in his beloved&quot;, in the 
        famous verse by Lu&iacute;s de Cam&otilde;es.</p>
      <p align="left">&#9;Therefore, there are some aspects of reality which can 
        only be known through <i>praxis</i> and others through <i>theoria</i>. 
        But <i>praxis</i> acts necessarily by denying the object, by reducing 
        it to a mere means and instrument, and <i>theoria</i> by the affirmation 
        of its plenitude and of its worth as an end. It becomes evident, then, 
        that:</p>
      <p align="left">&#9;3.4.1 There is a different dosage of <i>theoria</i> 
        and <i>praxis</i> for the knowledge of the various kinds of beings: whatever 
        is to me a means and an instrument can only be known by use; that which 
        is an end and worth in itself can only be known by me as long as I contemplate 
        it, love it, and defend its ontological integrity against any attempt 
        to transform it in something else. Van Gogh knew brushes and ink as he 
        used them, and on their use they were finished. But I know Van Gogh’s 
        pictures as they are kept intact for my contemplation.</p>
      <p align="left">&#9;3.4.2 In the realm of physical beings, there is no pure 
        <i>praxis</i> nor pure contemplation. There are only doses of them, according 
        to the scale of the ends’ worth and to the opportunity of the means. Only 
        the supreme end can be the object of <i>pure contemplation</i>. Only the 
        utterly insignificant object, without any ontological consistence and 
        worth of itself can be submitted to pure <i>praxis</i>. Both of these 
        limits are metaphysical, and never reached within the world of physical 
        experience.</p>
      <p align="left">&#9;3.4.3 However, there is a clear hierarchical distinction: 
        contemplation, being the objective and finality, has a primacy over <i>praxis</i>, 
        which, all in all, has no purpose but to cast away the obstacles that 
        separate us from contemplative enjoyment. <i>Man does not transform what 
        pleases him, but what does not please him</i>: he gives himself up in 
        contemplation for his own joy, and in <i>praxis</i> because of necessity 
        (even though there is, of course, a fun and contemplative element in <i>praxis</i> 
        that makes work pleasing in itself and that grants it worth that is independent 
        from its practical usefulness.)</p>
      <p align="left">&#9;3.4.4. From all that is above said we conclude that 
        to put <i>praxis</i> as a foundation and supreme value of human knowledge 
        is to bring in the reign of means in spite of the ends; it is to invert 
        the meaning of every human action and to deny the ontological consistence 
        of reality. It is to consider reality in its totality – including man 
        and his History, as well as the set of individual actions made by human 
        beings – as an immense instrument without any finality. It is to transform 
        the universe in a banana-straightening machine.</p>
      <p align="left">&#9;Here are in Marx the roots of the <i>&quot;nietzscheization&quot; 
        of the left</i>, in which many theoreticians, aroused in scandal, will 
        see a betrayal of Marxism. The philosophy of <i>praxis</i> contains, in 
        its core, the denial of the sense of reality, and the praise of absurdity, 
        which may not be explicit but remains nonetheless potent. It is obviously 
        an unconscious Epicurean heritage, rescued after the world crisis of Marxism, 
        when the left’s intellectuals went on a mass indulging on a pseudo-heroism 
        of <i>nonsense</i>, exalting themselves for continuing to defend social 
        ideals which, in a senseless world, can only consist in a Nietszschean 
        affirmation of the <i>will to power</i>, or in a gratuitous and arbitrary 
        <i>clinamen</i> which some, for pedantism or for fun, oppose to the gratuitous 
        and arbitrary <i>clinamen</i> of the atoms<sup><a name="9" href=#nota9>9</a></sup>. 
        The tough materialist wants to be a Clint Eastwood of philosophy, brave 
        over his horse, looking with indifference to the random movements of the 
        atoms in the prairie and showing contempt for the weak who need a meaning 
        for life. The lonely knight in the desert of absurd synthesises Marx, 
        Nietzsche and Epicurus.</p>
      <p align="left">3.5.There is a curious parallelism between the notions of 
        ‘object of theory’ and ‘object of <i>praxis</i>’ on one side, and, on 
        the other side, between ‘use value’ and ‘exchange value’. The ‘use value’ 
        of an object is, in a certain way, a property, a quality inherent to it, 
        something that is part of its ontological consistence, whereas the ‘exchange 
        value’ is an accident, as Marx himself points out: it depends on historical 
        circumstances which have nothing to do with the nature of the object. 
        One of the moral reproaches Marxism makes to capitalism is that the exchange 
        value ends up devouring the use value until it disappears, until it makes 
        all objects exist only as ‘merchandise’, as in the famous <i>boutade</i> 
        of Bertolt Brecht: &quot;I don’t know what it is. I only know the price&quot;. 
        It is the same as saying that capitalism absorbs the category of substance 
        in the category of passion. Whether capitalism really does it or this 
        is just rhetoric figure, an exaggeration, is something worth investigating. 
        Nonetheless, in <i>Karl Marx’s philosophy</i> such an inversion is obvious, 
        and in this case the reproach Marx makes to capitalism loses objective 
        consistency, being reduced to a mere projection: Marx reproaches capitalism 
        for something that is not necessarily in capitalism, but on his own subconscious 
        mental patterns.</p>
      <p align="left">3.6 Being a theory of action and not of the object, <i>praxis 
        will not acknowledge on the object any aspect other than that of its immediate 
        ‘transformability’</i>. Even without knowing what a tree is, I can use 
        the wood to make a table or a bookshelf. <i>Praxis</i> will, finally, 
        <i>deny the world and phenomena an ontological consistence of their own</i>, 
        one that man is able to know: it will liquefy all individual essences 
        in raw material for <i>more praxis</i> and that will result in a <i>new 
        and much more radical type of subjective idealism</i>, for the objective 
        world is nothing but the stage for <i>praxis</i>. Theory will say nothing 
        of the objects as they are, but only as they can be under hammer and forge.</p>
      <p align="left">&#9;It would be interesting to investigate how such a thing 
        could be conciliated with the alleged &quot;materialism&quot; of Marxism, 
        for Marxism reveals itself rather a subjective idealism, in the strict 
        and almost ‘Fichtean’ sense, with the only difference that its subject 
        is not the human individual, but the whole of historical mankind, before 
        whose praxis the natural universe – ‘matter’ – loses all substantiality 
        and is reduced to mere raw material of human action, lowering nature to 
        the status of <i>ancilla industri&aelig;</i>. It is this characteristic 
        of collective subjective idealism that grants Marxism its tremendous <i>illusionist 
        power</i> to drunken and pervert, of which men of great intelligence sometimes 
        are contaminated.</p>
      <p align="left">However, when I consider how small is the extension of the 
        material universe reached by human action (which amounts to part of the 
        Earth’s surface), and how infinite is the extension of celestial worlds 
        which we cannot transform but only contemplate, I ask myself if the theory 
        of <i>praxis</i> isn’t just a monstrous, universalising amplification 
        of a phenomenon that’s local and terrestrial – collectively subjective 
        – and if before the magnitude of the cosmos the ‘theoretical’ attitude 
        isn’t the wiser.</p>
      <p align="left">&#9;From the theory of <i>praxis</i> comes yet the idea 
        – which today is almost a dogma – that science arises <i>a posteriori</i> 
        from a rationalisation of technique, that is, of action: man does not 
        generate science by means of contemplation, but by means of the manipulation 
        of objects and of transforming them in something else. Then we lack an 
        explanation for the fact that in almost every civilisation one of the 
        first sciences to develop and reach perfection is no other than astronomy, 
        in which the objects are too far away to be able to be ‘transformed’, 
        and for that reason man can only <i>contemplate</i>. (A fanatic practicist 
        could raise the objection that astronomy developed for the purposes of 
        sea-travelling, but that would be nonsense because we can find a very 
        complex astronomy among people who were not sailors, like the Mayas). 
        This chronological and structural priority of Astronomy is highlighted 
        by Plato<sup><a name="10" href=#nota10>10</a></sup>, who sees the explanation 
        for the origin of all sciences in the contemplation of the regularity 
        and rationality of the celestial bodies’ movement. The Marxist explanation, 
        in its turn, can only stay afoot by means of a gross falsification of 
        the chronological order. In order for it to gain any verisimilitude in 
        the eyes of man, it was first necessary that the bourgeois society reduced 
        to a slave of technique and of practical utility an intellectual activity 
        in which for millennia those who practised it had seen an end in itself. 
        The practicist interpretation of the origin and meaning of science is 
        but a gross projection the bourgeois makes of his own criteria and values 
        upon the mentality of other times, which became unintelligible to him<sup><a name="11" href=#nota11>11</a></sup>.</p>

            in fac-simile in <i>The German Ideology</i>. Trad. S. Ryazanskaya. 
            Moscow: Progress Publishers, 1964. The verb <i>ver&auml;ndern</i> 
            derives from the root <i>ander</i> = &quot;other&quot;", and so the 
            most exact translation would be &quot;to alter it, to cause an alteration, 
            to change it&quot;. But any alteration, once it concerns not a simple 
            property or an accident of the given substance, is rather a <i>substitution</i>; 
            and, since the real world cannot be actually substituted by another, 
            this substitution can only take place in the realm of the collective 
            imagination by means of a sudden change or rotation of the perceptive 
            outlook – a <i>snapping</i>, according to Conway and Siegelman. Hence 
            the Marxist’s invulnerability against rational arguments. He not only 
            <i>thinks</i> differently from the non-Marxist: he <i>perceives</i> 
            the world under different categories, just a like the hysteric to 
            whom imagining is feeling. See <i>The New Age and the Cultural Revolution</i>, 
            Chapter III, item 3. However, this doesn’t mean that an open recant 
            from Marxism guarantees immediate freedom from its spell, just like 
            to become conscious of a neurosis does not mean to be cured. <i>Marxisme 
            pas mort</i>: it subsists like a complex in the unconscious of those
