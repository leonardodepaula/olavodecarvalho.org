      </p>
      <p>In Greece and in the Roman Empire, the use of minors for the sexual satisfaction 
        of adults was a tolerated and even prized costume. In China, castrating 
        young boys to sell them to rich pederasts was legitimate commerce during 
        millennia. In the Islamic world, the rigid morals that ordain the relationships 
        between men and women was not rarely compensated by the tolerance with 
        homosexual pedophilia. In some countries this lasted al least until the 
        beginning of the 20th century, making Algeria, for example, a garden of 
        delights for depraved travelers (read the memoirs of Andr&eacute; Gide, 
        &#147;Si le grain ne meurt&#148;). </p>
      <p>In all the places where the practice of pedophilia receded, it was the 
        influence of Christianism &#151; practically alone &#151; that freed the 
        children from this awful rule. </p>
      <p>But this had a price. It is as if an undercurrent of hate and resentment 
        had gone through two millennia of history, waiting for the moment of revenge. 
        This moment has arrived. </p>
      <p>The movement for the induction to pedophilia starts when Sigmund Freud 
        creates an erotic parody of the first years of human life, a version that 
        is very easily absorbed by the culture of the century. Since then, family 
        life appears more and more, in western imagining, as a pressure cooker 
        of repressed desires. In movies and in literature, children seem to have 
        nothing to do but to spy on the sexual life of their parents through the 
        keyhole, or to engage themselves in the most amazing erotic games. </p>
      <p>The politically explosive potential of the idea is soon put in use by 
        Wilhelm Reich, communist psychiatrist who organizes in Germany a movement 
        for the &#147;sexual liberation of youth&#148;, that was afterwards transferred 
        to the US, where it will constitute what is maybe the main idea and power 
        behind the student rebellions of the sixties. </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Kinsey Report, which today we know was a fraud all down 
        the line, demolishes the image of respectability of the parents, showing 
        them to the new generations either as sexually diseased hypocrites or 
        as feigning libertines. </p>
      <p>The advent of the birth-control pill and of condoms, which governments 
        start to distribute happily in schools, sounds like a call for total liberation 
        of infant-juvenile eroticism. Since then, the eroticism of childhood and 
        adolescence expands from academic and literary circles into the culture 
        of middle and lower classes, through an infinitude of films, TV programs, 
        &#147;meeting groups&#148;, courses on family guidance, ads, you name 
        it . Sexual education in schools becomes a direct induction of children 
        and youth to the practice of everything they saw on the movies and on 
        TV. </p>
      <p>But up to that point the legitimization of pedophilia appears only in 
        innuendo, hidden among general demands that bring it along as implicit 
        consequence. </p>
      <p>In 1981, however, &#147;Time&#148; announces that arguments pro-pedophilia 
        are becoming popular among sexual counselors. Larry Constantine, a family 
        therapist, proclaims that children &#147;have the right to express themselves 
        sexually, what means they can or cannot have sexual contact with older 
        people&#148;. One of the authors of the Kinsey Report, Wardell Pomeroy, 
        pontificates that incest &#147;can sometimes be beneficial&#148;. </p>
      <p>On the pretext of fighting discrimination, representants of the gay movement 
        are authorized to teach in schools the benefits of the homosexual practice. 
        Whoever opposes them is stigmatized, persecuted, fired. In a book praised 
        by J. Elders, ex-secretary of health of the US (the surgeon general &#151; 
        that same one who makes apocalyptic warnings against smoking), the journalist 
        Judith Levine affirms that the pedophiles are harmless and that the sexual 
        relation of a boy with a preacher can even be a beneficial thing. Really 
        dangerous, says Levine, are the parents, who project &#147;their fears 
        and their own desire for infantile flesh on that mythical molester of 
        children&#148;. </p>
      <p>Feminist organizations help to disarm children against pedophiles and 
        to arm them against the family, divulging the monstrous theory of an Argentine 
        psychiatrist according to which at least one in every four girls is raped 
        by her own father. </p>
      <p>The highest consecration of pedophilia comes in a 1998 edition of the 
        &#147;Psychological Bulletin&#148;, organ of the American Psychological 
        Association. The magazine affirms that sexual abuse in infancy &#147;does 
        not cause intense damage in a pervasive manner&#148;, and besides that, 
        recommends that the term pedophilia, &#147;charged with negative connotations&#148;, 
        be changed to &#147;intergenerational intimacy&#148;. </p>
      <p>It would be unthinkable that such a vast mental revolution, spreading 
        throughout society, would spare miraculously a special part of the public: 
        priests and seminarians. In their case, added to outside pressure, there 
        was a very special stimulus, well calculated to act from inside. In a 
        recent book, &#147;Goodbye, good men&#148;, the American reporter Michael 
        S. Rose shows that, for three decades, the gay organizations in the US 
        have been putting their people in the psychology departments of the Seminars 
        to make the entrance of the vocationally gifted postulants more difficult 
        and force the massive entrance of homosexuals in the clergy. In the most 
        important Seminars, homosexual propaganda became ostensive and heterosexual 
        students were forced by their superiors to submit to homosexual conduct. 
      </p>
      <p>Cornered and sabotaged, confounded and induced, it is fatal that sooner 
        or later many priests and seminarians end up yielding to the general infant-juvenile 
        orgy. And, when this happens, all the spokesmen of the &#147;liberated&#148; 
        modern culture, all the &#147;progressive&#148; establishment, all the 
        &#147;forward looking&#148; media, all the powers, therefore, that along 
        a hundred years were stripping children of their protecting aura of Christianity 
        to give them to the lust of perverse adults, suddenly rejoice, because 
        they found an innocent on which to lay all their blame. A hundred years 
        of pedophile culture are all of a sudden absolved, clean, paid for before 
        the Almighty: the only one to blame for it is... clerical celibacy! Christendom 
        will now pay for all the evil it stopped us from doing. </p>
      <p>Do not doubt this: the Church is now accused and humiliated because it 
        is innocent. Its detractors accuse it because they are themselves to blame. 
        Never before has Ren&eacute; Girard&#146;s theory &#150; of the persecution 
        of the scapegoat as an expedient for the restoring of an illusory unity 
        of a collectivity in a crisis &#150; found such patent, such obvious, 
        such universal and simultaneous confirmation. </p>
      <p>Whoever does not realize this, at this time, is divorced from his own 
        conscience. Has eyes, but does not see, has ears but does not listen. 
      </p>
      <p>But the Church itself, if it &#150; instead of denouncing them &#150; 
        prefers to curve itself before its attackers in a grotesque contrition 
        act, sacrificing pro forma a few pedophile priests so as not to have to 
        face the forces that were injected inside it like a virus, will have made 
        its most disastrous choice of the last two thousand years.</p>
