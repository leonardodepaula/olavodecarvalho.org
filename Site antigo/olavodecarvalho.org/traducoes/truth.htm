      <p align="center"><b class="destaque">I. Radical Questioning</b></p>
      <p align="left"><b>§ 1. Of satisfied frivolity</b></p>
      <p align="left"><i>Quid est veritas?</i> This is the most serious and the 
        most frivolous of questions, depending on the intention of the one who 
        asks it. Some admit that the meaning and the value of human life depend 
        on the existence of an eminently certain and reliable truth, which may 
        serve as a measurement to verify the validity of our thoughts. Others 
        think that life may perfectly well proceed without any truth and without 
        any foundation. Among the latter could probably be found good old Pontius 
        Pilate. When he exclaimed "What is truth?", he was not exactly asking 
        a question, but rather expressing, with a shrug, his little disposition 
        to ask that question seriously. The prospect of there not being any truth 
        — which would drive into despair those who judge that life needs it to 
        justify itself — was for Pilate a relief and a consolation, a guarantee 
        that he could go on living without any concerns. Some wager on the existence 
        of truth and <i>cherchent en g&eacute;missant</i>. Others turn their backs 
        and wash their hands of the matter. The verbal formula through which they 
        express themselves is the same: <i>Quid est veritas?</i> But in the difference 
        of their nuances lies all the distance that goes from tragic to comic.</p>
      <p align="left">The frivolous or comic school is widely dominant nowadays, 
        be it in the universities, be it in culture at large. Even those who seek 
        to believe in an effective truth surround it with all sorts of limits 
        and obstacles, for example by reducing it to the kind of partial and provisional 
        truth that is given to us by some of the experimental sciences. Others 
        stick to faith, saying that truth exists, but that it is above our understanding.</p>
      <p align="left">In any debate on the problem of truth these days, the agenda 
        consists almost invariably in rehashing the observations made by philosophers, 
        from Pyrrho to Richard Rorty, on the limits of human knowledge. These 
        limits, taken as a whole, make up a formidable mountain of obstacles to 
        any will to know the truth. And this mountain is an ever growing one, 
        with a peak that gets farther and farther out of reach the more we climb 
        it. From the half-witted objections of the Pyrrhonic school against the 
        validity of knowledge acquired through the senses, to the enormously complex 
        constructions with which Psychoanalysis denies the priority of conscience, 
        or Gramsci reduces all truth to the expression of ideologies that succeed 
        themselves through History, a lot has evolved in the machine that inoculates 
        disappointment in the truth-seeker. It causes no surprise that many of 
        the builders of this machine, as they add a new piece to it, instead of 
        regretting the consequent increase in human impotence, display on their 
        lips a smile similar to Pilate’s. The inexistence of truth – or the impossibility 
        of knowing it – is comforting for them. We shall see ahead what are the 
        deeper reasons for this strange satisfaction.</p>
      <p align="left"><b>§ 2. Provisional definition of truth</b></p>
      <p align="left">For the moment, let us leave those creatures aside, and 
        pose the question of truth on our behalf. As we do not yet know whether 
        truth exists nor what it affirms, we have to resort to a provisional definition 
        that will enable us to start the investigation without prejudging its 
        outcome. To comply with such a requirement, this provisional definition 
        has to express the mere intentional meaning of the word, as it appears 
        even in the mouth of those who deny the existence of any truth; because 
        in order to deny the existence of something it is necessary to understand 
        the meaning of the word that designates it.</p>
      <p align="left">So I say that truth – the truth whose existence we are still 
        not sure of, the truth whose existence and consistence will be the object 
        of our investigation, as it was of many other investigations that came 
        before us – is the permanent and universal cognitive foundation of the 
        validity of judgements. If we say, for example, that the sole foundation 
        of the validity of our judgements is their utility, we deny the existence 
        of a cognitive foundation. That is, we deny the existence of truth through 
        the denial of one of the elements that makes up its definition. The same 
        happens if we say that all valid judgements are founded on faith. If we 
        state, however, that there are no valid judgements of any kind, then we 
        deny the existence of any foundation, cognitive or not. If we state that 
        judgements are valid only for a specific time and location, we deny that 
        the foundation may be permanent. If we state that judgements are only 
        valid subjectively to the one who utters them, we deny that the foundation 
        may be universal. If we say that the foundation of the validity of judgements 
        belongs only to formal logic, without ever being able to reach the real 
        objects mentioned in the judgement, we deny that this foundation has any 
        cognitive meaning.</p>
      <p align="left">All these denials of truth presuppose the definition of 
        truth as the permanent and universal cognitive foundation of the validity 
        of judgements. Likewise, if we say that truth exists, that it is knowable, 
        that based upon it we can build valid knowledge, we will not have added 
        or subtracted anything from that definition, but only stated that the 
        object defined in it does exist. Our provisional definition, as it is 
        therefore consistent with the two totally opposed currents of opinion 
        that dispute the question, constitutes a superior and neutral ground from 
        which the investigation may start without any prejudices and with all 
        honesty and rigor.</p>
      <p align="left"><b>§ 3. Is the radical questioning of truth possible?</b></p>
      <p align="left">We start thus from a consensus. The next step of the investigation 
        consists in asking whether truth, as defined, can or cannot be the object 
        of radical questioning. By ‘radical questioning’ I mean that kind of questioning 
        that, admitting <i>ex hypothesi</i> the inexistence of its object — as 
        for example it was done many times with the existence of God, of innate 
        ideas, or of the exterior world — leads to a conclusion that may be favorable 
        to the inexistence or to the existence of its object.</p>
      <p align="left">The radical questioner of God, of innate ideas, or of the 
        exterior world may question them because he positions himself, from the 
        outset, outside of the divine, innate or worldly ground, i.e., he reasons 
        as if God, or innate ideas, or the exterior world did not exist. As his 
        investigation unfolds, he will either come to the conclusion that his 
        premise is absurd — admitting therefore the existence of that whose inexistence 
        he had postulated —, or inversely he will come to the conclusion that 
        the premise holds perfectly well and that what was supposed to be inexistent 
        indeed does not exist.</p>
      <p align="left">The most classical example of this method is Descartes’. 
        He presupposes the inexistence of the exterior world, of what is acquired 
        by the senses, of his own body, etc. And he continues reasoning along 
        this line until he finds a limit — the <i>cogito ergo sum</i> — that forces 
        him to retreat and to admit the existence of all he had initially denied.</p>
      <p align="left">Radical questioning is the hardest test to which philosophy 
        can submit any idea or being that might exist.</p>
      <p align="left">What we should then ask, right after obtaining a formal 
        definition of truth, is whether the truth so defined may be the object 
        of radical questioning. As surprising as it may be to many, the answer 
        is a flat no. The truth cannot be the object of radical questioning.</p>
      <p align="left">No investigation about the truth, as radical as it may be, 
        can take as a premise the inexistence of any permanent and universal cognitive 
        foundation of the validity of judgements and then continue to reason in 
        a manner consistent with this premise until reaching some positive or 
        negative result. And it cannot do so for a very simple reason: the affirmation 
        of the absolute inexistence of any permanent and universal cognitive foundation 
        of the validity of judgements would constitute, itself, the permanent 
        and universal cognitive foundation of subsequent judgements made along 
        the same line of investigation. The investigation would be paralyzed as 
        soon as formulated.</p>
      <p align="left">Let us briefly examine some of the classic strategies for 
        the denial of truth to which the questioner could resort in order to escape 
        from this <i>cul-de-sac</i>.</p>
      <p align="left">We may try for example the pragmatistic strategy. It states 
        that the validity of judgements rests on its practical utility, consequently 
        assuming that the foundation of such validity is <i>not</i> of a cognitive 
        nature. If we said that the inexistence of a permanent and universal cognitive 
        foundation of the validity of judgements is not itself a permanent and 
        universal cognitive foundation, but only a practical foundation, either 
        this practical foundation would have to be permanent and universal, or 
        it would only be partial and provisional.</p>
      <p align="left">In the first hypothesis, we would have two problems: on 
        the one hand we would stumble upon the paradox of a universal utility, 
        that is, of something that might usefully serve all practical ends, even 
        the most contradictory. It would be the universal means for all ends or, 
        more precisely, the universal panacea. On the other, we should ask whether 
        the belief in this panacea would have, in turn, a cognitive foundation 
        or whether it would only be a practical utility, and so on infinitely.</p>
      <p align="left">In the second hypothesis — i.e., if the questioner admits 
        that the affirmation of the inexistence of truth is only a partial and 
        provisional foundation for the validity of subsequent judgements — there 
        would always remain the unshakable possibility that other permanent and 
        universal cognitive foundations might subsist outside the ground so delimited, 
        capable of validating an infinity of other judgements. The investigation 
        could thus proceed indefinitely, jumping from one provisional foundation 
        to another, without ever being able to found itself on its own premise, 
        that is, on the radical inexistence of truth.</p>
      <p align="left">Let us then try a second strategy, subjective relativism. 
        It proclaims, as did Protagoras, that "man is the measure of all things", 
        what is currently interpreted as meaning "to each his own". In other words, 
        what is true is true only from the point of view of the one who thinks 
        it is true, and it may be false from the point of view of everyone else. 
        Can this statement provide the basis for a radical questioning of truth, 
        in such a way that the denial of the existence of a permanent and universal 
        cognitive foundation of the validity of judgements does not become itself 
        the permanent and universal cognitive foundation that supports the validity 
        of subsequent judgements in the same line of investigation? Saying it 
        in a simpler way: can relativism deny the existence of judgements that 
        are valid for all men without this very denial becoming a valid judgement 
        for all men? To do it, relativism would have to deny the universality 
        of this denial, what would amount to admitting the existence of one, or 
        some, or an infinity of judgements that are valid for all men. So relativism 
        itself would turn out to be relative. By stating that some judgements 
        are not valid for all men — which implies that others may be —relativism 
        would end up becoming a platitude without any philosophical meaning. Subjective 
        relativism cannot achieve a radical questioning of truth, as pragmatism 
        also could not.</p>
      <p align="left">Could historicism then do it? Historicism declares that 
        all truth is but the expression of a temporal, limited world view. Men 
        think this or that not because this or that imposes itself as a universal 
        and permanent obligatory truth, but only because it imposes itself in 
        a specific place and for a limited period of time. But can historicism 
        avoid that the statement of these limits becomes itself the permanent 
        and universal cognitive foundation of the validity of judgements? In order 
        to avoid that, it would be necessary to admit that there may be some foundation 
        that denies the very statement of those limits. But if that foundation 
        exists; then there is a truth whose validity is unlimited by space and 
        time, a truth whose validity escapes from historic conditioning. And therefore 
        historicism would be reduced to the miserable realization that some foundations 
        of validity are historically conditioned while others are not, not even 
        being able to apply this distinction to concrete cases without thereby 
        affirming the invalidity of the historical principle taken as a universal 
        rule.</p>
      <p align="left">I will spare the reader the enumeration of all the possible 
        subterfuges and their detailed refutation. He can do that himself as an 
        exercise if he so wishes, and I even encourage him to do so. In any case, 
        as many times as he tries them, he will always return to the same point: 
        it is not possible to deny the existence of a universal and permanent 
        cognitive foundation of the validity of judgements, under any pretext, 
        without this denial and its respective pretext becoming themselves a universal 
        and permanent cognitive foundation of the validity of judgements. And 
        thus it voids the next denial through which it would proceed the investigation, 
        if it only could. In short, truth, as we defined it, cannot be the object 
        of radical questioning. Neither can the possibility of knowing it. Once 
        we deny that it is possible to know a permanent and universal cognitive 
        foundation of the validity of judgements, either this very impossibility 
        becomes such a foundation, thereby admitting its own lack of any foundation; 
        or else, in order to avoid this embarrassing situation we should limit 
        ourselves to stating that some judgements do not have any foundation while 
        others probably do, a statement that lies within the means of any school 
        kid.</p>
      <p align="left">Not being capable of hitting its target, the enemy of the 
        truth is therefore eternally doomed to biting the edges, without ever 
        reaching the vital center of what he wishes to destroy. He will now deny 
        one truth, then another, now with one pretext, then with another, varying 
        his strategies and the directions of his attack. But he will never be 
        able to free himself from his fate: each denial of a truth will be the 
        affirmation of another; and that denial as well as this affirmation will 
        always result in the affirmation of truth as such, i.e., of the effective 
        existence of some permanent and universal cognitive foundation of the 
        validity of judgements.</p>
      <p align="left">This also explains the continuous, unlimited and irrepressible 
        proliferation of the denials of truth and their total incapacity of suppressing 
        from the face of the Earth the belief in the existence of truth, the belief 
        in the possibility of knowing the truth, the belief in the actual and 
        full possession of a truth capable of providing a permanent and universal 
        cognitive foundation for the validity of judgements.</p>
      <p align="left">That is why the number and variety of the attacks to the 
        truth, from Pyrrho to Richard Rorty, greatly exceed the number and the 
        variety of the defenses that formally present themselves as such. That 
        is because these very attacks, however their authors deplore it, always 
        end up turning themselves into defenses and praise for the truth. Thereby, 
        they do not only reduce the workload of the apologist of truth, but also 
        enliven what they wished to lay to rest and honor what they wished to 
        humiliate.</p>
      <p align="left">This is also the reason why the beginner, impressed by the 
        variety and continuity of charges against the truth that are observed 
        in the history of philosophy — nowadays in a notably increasing speed 
        — swiftly adheres to skepticism, so that he will not feel as belonging 
        to an isolated and weakened minority. But as he proceeds with his studies, 
        he overcomes that first impression based only in apparent quantity. He 
        is then no longer able to maintain that position as he realizes that the 
        strength does not rest in the number of those who deny the truth, as impressive 
        as they may seem, but rather in the quality of the happy few who serenely 
        affirm it.</p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><b class="destaque">II. The truth is not a property of 
        judgements</b></p>
      <p align="left"><b>§ 1. Truth and truthfulness</b></p>
      <p align="left">The impossibility of radical questioning that we verified 
        in the preceding chapter leads us to the conclusion that the truth may 
        only be attacked by parts, and that each denial of a part reaffirms the 
        validity of the whole. Said in another manner, what may be questioned 
        are truths. "The" truth cannot be questioned and indeed never was, except 
        in words, that is, by the pretending of a denial that ends up being an 
        affirmation of truth.</p>
      <p align="left">But this takes us a step ahead in the investigation. A venerable 
        tradition, initiated by Aristotle, affirms that truth is in the judgements, 
        that it is a property of judgements. Some judgements "possess" the truth 
        while others do not. The first ones are called true judgements, the second 
        ones, false judgements. Therefore the set of true judgements is a subset 
        of the set of possible judgements. Possible judgements, in turn, constitute 
        a subset of the set of the human cognitive acts; these are a subset of 
        the set of the mental acts, which are a subset of the set of human acts, 
        and so forth. Therefore, the territory of truth is a small detached area 
        inside a vast world of thoughts, acts and beings.</p>
      <p align="left">Is this really possible? How could truth be the foundation 
        of the validity of all judgements and at the same time a property of some 
        of them in particular? Isn’t that a blatant contradiction or at least 
        a problem?</p>
      <p align="left">To come to terms with it and solve the problem, it is necessary 
        that we agree in a distinction between truth and truthfulness. <i>Truth</i> 
        is the permanent and universal cognitive foundation of the validity of 
        judgements. <i>Truthfulness</i> is a quality observed in some judgements, 
        according to which their validity has a permanent and universal cognitive 
        foundation.</p>
      <p align="left">Once we understand that, it becomes evident that the truth 
        is a founding condition for truthfulness, not the opposite. If there was 
        no permanent and universal cognitive foundation of the validity of judgements, 
        no judgement could have a permanent and universal cognitive foundation. 
        However, if one particular judgement possesses this foundation, nothing 
        in the world can establish that it is the only one to possess it, i.e., 
        that the existence of the foundation depends of the existence of this 
        particular judgement. Yet this particular judgement could not exist and 
        be true if there existed no truth. The truth is thus logically prior to 
        truthfulness and constitutes its foundation.</p>
      <p align="left">Still, being the foundation of truthfulness, truth is also 
        the foundation of untruthfulness, because false judgements are only false 
        insofar as they may be truthfully disproved, be it through their simple 
        denial — itself truthful — be it through the affirmation of a contrary 
        truthful judgement.</p>
      <p align="left">Being the foundation not only of the truthfulness of true 
        judgements, but also of the untruthfulness of false judgements, truth 
        must be present in both, while truthfulness is only present in the true 
        judgements and cannot be present in false ones. Thus, the territory of 
        truth is not identical to the set of possible true judgements, but encompasses 
        it together with the set of the possible false ones.</p>
      <p align="left"><b>§ 2. Is the foundation of all judgements a judgement?</b></p>
      <p align="left">Must the truth, foundation of all judgements, necessarily 
        be a judgement? Can only a judgement be the foundation of another judgement? 
        The answer is yes and no. Yes, if by foundation we mean, restrictively 
        and conventionally, the premise upon which the proof of a judgement is 
        founded. But a premise states something about something, and what it states 
        is not a judgement but rather its object. Let me say, for example, that 
        turtles have shells. I found this judgement upon the definitions of turtle 
        and shell, which are judgements. But I found these definitions upon the 
        observation — which is not a judgement — of turtles and shells, which 
        are not judgements either. Should not that observation also be true, by 
        apprehending traces which are truly present in true objects? Or should 
        I resort to the subterfuge according to which the observation must only 
        be <i>exact</i>, the concept of "true" not being applicable to it ? But 
        then what is the meaning of "exact" in this case, if not that which informs 
        me nothing more nor less of what I truly observed in what an object truly 
        showed? Moreover, is it an authentic exactitude or just its simulacrum? 
        There is no way out: either there is truth in the observation itself or 
        it cannot be exact, correct, adequate, sufficient, nor have any other 
        quality that recommends it except if this quality be true.</p>
      <p align="left">So the foundation of the truthfulness of a judgement rests 
        not only in the truthfulness of the judgements that work as its premises 
        but — in the case of judgements concerning objects of experience — also 
        in the truth of the data wherefrom I extracted such premises and in the 
        truth of what I know about such data from experience.</p>
      <p align="left">Furthermore, if the foundation of judgements had to be always 
        itself a judgement, the primary foundation of all judgements would be 
        a judgement destitute of any foundation. Taken to this <i>cul-de-sac</i>, 
        Aristotle affirmed that the knowledge of the first principles is immediate 
        and intuitive. But he meant only that these principles had no proof, not 
        that they were devoid of any foundation. The principle of identity, for 
        example, thus expressed in the judgement A = A, does not have behind it 
        any judgement that may work as a premise to its demonstration. But it 
        has an objective foundation in the ontological identity of each being 
        to itself, which is not a judgement. What can be known intuitively is 
        this ontological identity and not the judgement A = A, that only manifests 
        it. So the intuition of the first logic principle does not take the form 
        of a judgement, but rather that of an immediate evidence which, in itself, 
        is not a judgement. There cannot be a judgement unless this immediate 
        evidence is transformed by signs into a <i>verbum mentis</i>. That is, 
        into a conscious agreement which – not yet being a proposition, an affirmation 
        in words – is not anymore just the pure and simple intuition, but rather 
        its mental reflex and therefore a derivative and secondary cognitive act, 
        not a primary one.</p>
      <p align="left">So if the territory of logic premises begins with judgements 
        that affirm the first principles, that territory is very far from encompassing 
        all the field of cognitive foundations that extends itself into the realm 
        of intuitive perception, be it of the objects of experience, be it of 
        the first principles. </p>
      <p align="left">The falsity of the image of truth as a small detached zone 
        in the vast territory of possible judgements becomes thus evident. Rather, 
        it is all judgements, true and false, that are but a modest spot in the 
        immense territory of truth.</p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><b class="destaque">III. Where is the truth?</b></p>
      <p align="left"><b>§ 1. Truth as a realm</b></p>
      <p align="left">So we have come to understand that truth, being the criterion 
        for the validity of judgements, cannot be an immanent property of these 
        very judgements. Neither can it be something totally external to the judgements 
        which would evaluate them from the outside, because this evaluation would 
        in turn be a judgement. If I say "the chicken has laid an egg", where 
        can the truth of this judgement be? In the judgement itself, independently 
        from the chicken, or in the chicken, independently from the judgement? 
        The absurdity of the first hypothesis led Spinoza to proclaim the inanity 
        of the judgements that arise from experience, which are never valid or 
        invalid in themselves and always depend on something external. For him, 
        a true judgement would have to be true in itself, independently from everything 
        else. As, for example, A = A does not depend on what is A or on any other 
        external verification. But the identity of A to A lies not only in the 
        judgement that affirms it, but also in the consistency of A, whatever 
        A may be. There is no purely logic judgement that can be true or false 
        in itself without reference to the object of the judgement. Even a judgement 
        that refers only to itself unfolds into a judgement that affirms something 
        and into a judgement about which something is affirmed, and one is certainly 
        not the other. Affirming that a judgement is true in itself cannot mean 
        a total alienation of the "world" that is supposed by the very possibility 
        of enunciating a judgement. Fleeing to the realm of formal identity does 
        not solve the problem at all. Should we then say, along with an old tradition, 
        that truth is in the relation between judgement and object? Now, this 
        relationship is stated through a judgement that in turn must have a relation 
        with its object – the original relation between judgement and object – 
        and so on infinitely.</p>
      <p align="left">The other hypothesis, that the truth of the judgement "the 
        chicken has laid an egg" is to be found in the chicken, independently 
        from the judgement, would take us to equally insurmountable difficulties. 
        It would amount to saying that the truth of the judgement does not depend 
        on the judgement being made. That is, that once the chicken has laid an 
        egg, the judgement that affirms it is true even though it does not exist 
        as a judgement. Edmund Husserl would subscribe to this view without winking: 
        the truth of a judgement is a question of pure logic that has nothing 
        to do with the merely empiric question of a specific judgement being made 
        by someone one day. The confusion between the sphere of the truth of judgements 
        and the sphere of their psychological production did indeed a lot of harm 
        to philosophy, and Husserl has definitely clarified that confusion. But 
        if the chicken laid an egg and nobody said anything about it, truth in 
        this case is not in the judgement, but rather in the fact. The judgement 
        that has not yet been made cannot be true or false, it can only have the 
        possibility to be true or false. Being true that the chicken laid an egg, 
        the judgement that affirms it will be true if formulated, while the truth 
        of the fact is already given by the appearance of the egg.</p>
      <p align="left">But if the truth of the judgement "the chicken laid an egg" 
        is neither in the judgement independently from the chicken, nor in the 
        chicken independently from the judgement, not even in the relation between 
        chicken and judgement, where after all can it be?</p>
      <p align="left">We have just seen that, independently from the judgements 
        that affirm them, or from any judgements that might be made about them, 
        the objects they refer to may also be true or false. "The chicken laid 
        an egg" is opposed to "the chicken did not lay an egg", independently 
        from somebody saying so or not. There is identity and contradiction in 
        the real world, independently from the judgement which affirms or denies 
        anything about it, and even before this judgement is made. In other words 
        that lead to the same result: truth exists in reality and not only in 
        judgements, or it could not exist in judgements at all. There is truth 
        in the fact that the chicken laid an egg, there is truth in the judgement 
        that affirms it, and there is also truth in the relation between the judgement 
        and the fact, as well as in the judgement that affirms this relationshipt: 
        the truth thus cannot be "in" the fact, nor "in" the judgement, nor "in" 
        the relation, but it has to be in all three of them.</p>
      <p align="left">Furthermore, if it is in the three of them, it must also 
        be somewhere else, unless we admit that a single fact and the judgement 
        that affirms it, and the relation that connects both of them, may be true 
        even if everything else is false. But this "everything else" that is not 
        contained neither in the fact, nor in the judgement, nor in the relationship, 
        necessarily includes the very existence of facts, as well as of logic 
        principles implied in the judgement and in the relationship. If there 
        are no facts and logic principles, a chicken will uselessly lay eggs in 
        the realm of the non-fact, and a relation between fact and judgement will 
        uselessly be sought in the realm of illogicality. Hence, the truth of 
        a single fact, of a single judgement, and of their relationship, imply 
        the existence of truth as a realm that at once encompasses and transcends 
        facts, judgements and relationships.</p>
      <p align="left">Searching for truth in the fact, or in the judgement, or 
        in the relations between them, is like searching for space in bodies, 
        in their measurements, and in the distance from one body to another. As 
        space is not in the bodies, nor in their measurements, nor in their distances 
        – but rather bodies, measurements and distances are in the space – likewise, 
        truth is not in facts, nor in judgements, nor in their relations, but 
        they are all in the truth, or they are not anywhere. And even this "not 
        being anywhere", if it means anything and is not only a <i>flatus vocis</i>, 
        must be in the truth.</p>
      <p align="left">Truth is not a property of facts, judgements, or relationships. 
        It is the realm within which facts, judgements and relations occur.</p>
      <p align="left"><b>§ 2. Is the truth an <i>a priori</i> form of knowledge?</b></p>
      <p align="left">At this point, the kantian temptation is practically unavoidable. 
        As a condition for the possibility of facts, judgements and relationships, 
        the truth is effectively an <i>a priori</i> condition. But is it an <i>a 
        priori</i> condition for the existence of these three things or only for 
        the "knowledge" we can have of them?</p>
      <p align="left">This problem is solved in a simple and brutal way: if we 
        say that the truth is an <i>a priori</i> form of knowledge and intend 
        this statement to be true, then knowledge must be in the truth and not 
        truth in the knowledge, because what is <i>a priori</i> cannot be immanent 
        to something which it itself determines. To be an <i>a priori</i> condition 
        of knowledge, truth must necessarily be an <i>a priori</i> condition of 
        something else that is not knowledge, but rather its object. Knowledge, 
        like facts, judgements and relationships, is within the realm of truth 
        and that is so independently of knowledge being considered exclusively 
        in its eidetic content or as a fact. The truth of what is known, the truth 
        of the knower, and the truth of knowing are all aspects of truth, and 
        truth is not an aspect of any of them.</p>
      <p align="left">After all there is no kantian way out. Either knowledge 
        is in the truth or it is not anywhere at all.</p>
