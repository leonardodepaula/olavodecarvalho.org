      </p>
      <p>At a moment when the drug-dealing guerrillas of the Farc invade our schools 
        in order to teach our children their genocidal doctrine; at a moment when 
        an organization involved with guerrilla propaganda tries out its power 
        of strategic action, simultaneously blocking almost all the roads in the 
        country – at this moment, journalists and district attorneys join each 
        other in an operation destined to incriminate and abort the investigations 
        that the Army is making on the illegal activities of MST and of other 
        left-wing non-governmental organizations. </p>
      <p>If this is not an act of revolutionary misinformation in the best KGB 
        style, then it is at least a substantial support, offered with prodigious 
        lack of conscience and levity, to Fidel Castro’s plan of  &quot;reconquering 
        in Latin America what was lost in East Europe&quot;. </p>
      <p>Numbed by 40 years of &quot;Cultural Revolution&quot;, which – without 
        finding the least resistance – made cat's-paw of its ability of thought, 
        public opinion seems to accept by its nominal value the accusations against 
        the investigation. And it does that without ever asking if the crime under 
        investigation is not a million times graver than mere words, even if offensive, 
        found in an investigator’s report. </p>
      <p>When he cries out against the use of the expression &quot;adversary power&quot;, 
        the minister of the Superior Military Court (STM), Flávio Bierrenbach, 
        a man that owes his political career to leftist support, shows no consideration 
        to the fact that propaganda or the training of guerrillas really are things 
        adverse to the democratic regime. </p>
      <p>If the Army consents to &quot;give explanations&quot;, instead of accusing 
        those who tie the hands of the legal powers to give way to communist aggression, 
        then we will have installed in this country, overnight, as if by magic, 
        a new legal order, where the fomenting of guerrillas will be done under 
        the protection of the State, and the opposition to it will be crime. We 
        go to sleep in the arms of a decomposing democracy, and will awake in 
        the claws of a newborn communist dictatorship. </p>
      <p>I ask myself whether the newspaper that – in partnership with the district 
        attorneys – created this Kafkian situation is not aware of the fact that, 
        with this, it went far beyond mere journalistic defamation of the Armed 
        Forces and became an instrument of the revolutionary mutation of the regime. 
        I ask myself and I answer myself: it cannot be unaware of what it does, 
        for, in its edition of July 7, 1993, the same newspaper gave the news, 
        in alarming tones, of the infiltration of leftist agents in the Federal 
        Police and in the Ministry of Justice. What pretext could it have now 
        to ignore that it has become an accomplice of these same people to do 
        what it was once afraid they would do?  </p>
      <p>Instead of stopping its investigations, intimidated by the media, what 
        the Army should do is to investigate further. It should investigate who 
        are these district attorneys who, in an inquiry done &quot;under secrecy 
        of justice&quot;, invite journalists to violate this secret. What is the 
        connection of these people with CUT, with PT, with MST? Did the espionage 
        service from MST itself collaborate in this operation? Or is it licit 
        for the MST to spy on the Army, but not for the Army to spy on MST? And 
        those journalists, in their turn, are they collaborators, militants or 
        “travelling companions&quot; of the same organizations accused in the 
        report from the Army? To make a long story short: under the appearance 
        of a mere journalistic scandal, is what we see not a lethal blow destined 
        to neutralize beforehand any possibility of anticommunist national resistance? 
      </p>
      <p>Or is it forbidden to ask these things?  Is the simple fact of speaking 
        them enough to turn me into an “adversary force&quot;? Are we already 
        in the new Brazil announced by Fidel Castro, in which it will be crime 
        to oppose communist action? </p>
      <p>Two promising reasons suggest that it is not so. The courageous statement 
        made by the commander of the Army in the Day of the soldier shows that 
        our land force is not ready to be made an accomplice of the scheme set 
        up against it. And the decision of the court, which determined the devolution 
        to the Army of the documentation apprehended in Marabá, also shows that 
        the Judiciary Power is not ready to be an instrument of its own destruction. 
      </p>
      <p>But – let no one doubt this – the scandal set up around the documents 
        from Marabá might be only the first chapter of the story. After all, it 
        was through the scandal industry that Adolf Hitler put the German Armed 
        Forces on their knees and transferred to his party the control of the 
        intelligence services. And if there is any trace that most clearly defines 
        the mentality of revolutionary movements of all shades, it is their ability 
        to try again. </p>
