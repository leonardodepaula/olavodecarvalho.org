      <p><font size="3">Sceptics, relativists and pragmatists, who champion the 
        idea that knowledge is something merely functional, operational have the 
        grandest of pretences, namely that in a democracy rigorous, proven truth 
        will undermine the health of the body politic. They suggest that if you 
        claim to know the truth it is because you are utterly intolerant of adverse 
        opinion. Such is their point. They then set out to argue that you can 
        prove nothing whatever; and will go on to claim that the world will not 
        be happy until all the theories have cancelled out one another, and mankind 
        has finally acknowledged that there is no such thing as truth; that whatever 
        goes under this name are just figments. These, again, are only provisional, 
        if useful in nature. Once you have abolished the test of truth, all ideas 
        have just about the same value. At this stage, you will have perfect democracy.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3">People used to judging ideas by their face value, and 
        this means nearly the whole of the human race, will not think twice before 
        jumping to this conclusion, if only because from their standpoint they 
        are flattered to find out that their opinions being as useful and as provisional 
        as any other these can justifiably be ranked beside those of Aristotle 
        and Leibnitz.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3">But this persuasive set of appearances leaves out the 
        plain, brutal fact that neither of this century’s major brands of totalitarianism 
        - Communism or Nazism – accepted the existence of an objective truth; 
        much to the contrary their tenet was that ideas, rather than instrumental 
        to the knowledge of the real world were just tools that could be used 
        to change it. Karl Marx was explicit on his head in his ‘Theses on Feuerbach&quot;. 
        One odd peculiarity of the Marxist view is the notion that History cannot 
        be approached ‘from the outside’; nor for that matter can its unfathomable 
        depths be explored theoretically other than by a subject who as a preliminary 
        step has himself joined the cause of the proletariat; for not until the 
        subject is personally engaged in the working class struggle is he expected 
        to grasp the revolutionary process from within, in other words, the dialectic 
        process itself through which this process evolves. When he claimed that 
        class war was inextricably both a scientific theory and the rule of thumb 
        for the revolutionary praxis, Marx distorted the very idea of ‘scientific 
        theory’. Stripped of its role as an intellectual synthesis of objective 
        findings, scientific theory was no more than a means of producing or modifying 
        these findings in retrospect to fit the theory.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3">Nobody grasped this notion so thoroughly as did Lenin 
        when he found that a proletarian revolution was conceivable in a nation 
        where no proletariat existed; all that was needed was for a self-appointed 
        &eacute;lite of future proletarians to take over, and once in power to 
        set about creating a proletariat.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3">Even more blatantly instrumental and pragmatic was Adolf 
        Hitler’s idea of truth. As reported by Hermann Rauschning in his &quot;Conversations 
        with Hitler&quot;(1940), he said, &quot;I am quite aware that in a scientific 
        sense there is no such thing as ‘races’. But as a politician I must have 
        a concept to justify the destruction of the existing order to give place 
        to a new one.&quot; This is as though the ghost of Karl Marx were haunting 
        his surroundings – the world, after all, is not meant to be described, 
        but changed. </font></p>
      <p><font size="3">He who would believe an objective truth will look for 
        one and put it to the test of proof. Conversely, he who will reduce the 
        truth to a tool of change for the world cannot abide the onus of proof, 
        all he has to do is to eliminate whoever stands in the way as an obstacle 
        to change.</font></p>
