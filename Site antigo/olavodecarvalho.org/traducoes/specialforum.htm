      <p>The World Social Forum would only be another international festival for 
        the exhibitionism of the left, with nothing special to it, if it did not 
        stand out precisely by this one uncommon detail: it is the most shameless 
        undertaking of ideological propaganda ever financed with public money, 
        in this or in any other Brazilian state. It is illegal all down the line, 
        and any citizen, through a very simple legal popular motion in Justice, 
        can frustrate its realization at any moment.</p>
      <p>Not withstanding its pretension of constituting a leftist &quot;pendant&quot; 
        to the periodic encounters of theoreticians of capitalism in the Swiss 
        city of Davos, it is nothing but a burlesque inversion of the Forum of 
        Liberty, realized annually by the gaúcho conservatives with huge success. 
        Between the two forums, however, there are three differences. First: the 
        Forum of Liberty is realized strictly inside the law, with money from 
        voluntary contributions from participants and sponsors. Second, in this 
        forum the guests represent all ideological trends – liberal, conservative, 
        nationalists, leftists –, whereas its &quot;Social&quot; version is a 
        very élitist Club – where only the ideologically correct can enter – what 
        marks with precision the distance between debate and propaganda.</p>
      <p>The third difference is the most significant. In the Forum of Freedom, 
        people are asked to speak according to their experience on the subject. 
        No one steps out of one’s shoe in there. To me, for instance no one asks 
        about unemployment or housing needs, problems that I only had contact 
        with in the condition of speechless victim, and of which all I would have 
        to say is that they really are a load of trouble. However, I have done 
        better in areas such as education, culture, history, etc., and the Forum 
        of Liberty asks me questions on these subjects. To talk about the banking 
        system, they invite Gustavo Franco, who knows how to make the thing work. 
        To talk about private enterprise, they invite Mr.Jorge Gerdau, who has 
        one that works. And so on. On the other hand, the people from the Social 
        Forum announce that they possess the solution to evils of great bulk: 
        the misery of the poor nations, social exclusion, and things like that. 
        It would be unfair to expect that these people showed us their achievement 
        list – or, at least, their ideology – concerning the solution of these 
        problems. We could ask, for instance: to how many people has socialism 
        given a better life? If we exclude the members of the &quot;nomenklatura&quot;, 
        who obviously had the best of lives, the amount we obtain as answer cannot 
        be called void, because it is negative: in almost all the socialist nations, 
        the quality of life is today inferior to the one before socialism. At 
        best, it is the same: when Cuba brags about having the third or fourth 
        place of the continent in quality of health and education, they omit that 
        they already had it since 1951, eight years before the revolution. In 
        other countries, such as Vietnam, hunger and misery reached apocalyptic 
        levels, while in China the average salary of a worker, after half a century 
        of redemptive murders &quot;soi disant&quot; destined to elevate their 
        standard of life, is 40 dollars per month. </p>
      <p>Against that, in this valley of darkness that is capitalism, the poorest 
        fraction of the North-American and European population today have a consuming 
        level much superior to the middle class of the fifties. In Africa, on 
        the other hand – that according to the socialist doctrine would experience 
        an amazing economic blooming as soon as the Europeans left with their 
        damned colonialist investments – whole populations die of starvation today, 
        and the Social Forum, according to what was announced in this same publication 
        by the unforgettable Mr. Luiz Marques, will show us that the blame falls 
        on the malevolent ex-colonialists that do not put their money there anymore. 
        Such is the know-how that this people will come to transmit to the gaúchos 
        in exchange for their tax money. </p>
      <p>Of all the economic problems in the world, the socialist doctrine solved 
        up to now only one: its own. Each of the people who disseminate this doctrine 
        has a good job in a university, newspaper or research institution in prosperous 
        capitalist countries, and not one of them was ever idiot enough to propose 
        solving, not the problems “of the world”, but those from some socialist 
        country. Not daring to take care of their own backyard, they became specialists 
        on minding other people’s businesses. Socialism, as we well know, has 
        no autonomous life, but feeds from the donations of insane capitalist 
        dilettantes from New York and Geneva, which support it more or less like 
        someone that keeps in his house a tank of alligators. In retribution, 
        the alligators show their teeth and shake their tails to impress the visitors. 
        This will be the sole utility of the Social Forum. The difference is that 
        the salaries of the alligators will not be paid by insane capitalists 
        from New York and Geneva, but by the gaúcho taxpayers.</p>
