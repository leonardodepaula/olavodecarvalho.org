<p>There are Colombian guerrilla fighters roaming freely inside national borders 
  and the government's effort to disarm them is but a tiny bit of the effort governor 
  Garotinho makes to disarm the pacific citizens of Rio de Janeiro. The MST (<i>Movimento 
  dos Sem-Terra</i>), Brazil's famous landless movement, tears off its mask, declaring 
  they want not land but power, while members of the intelligentsia make an open 
  invitation for the military to join the Left in a violent action against the 
  government. The government of Rio de Janeiro teaches the Military Police soldiers 
  how to disobey their officers, while in the press the growing level of verbal 
  violence against the President has become an outspoken plea for his destitution 
  no matter how. Mysteriously originated organizations spread e-mails claiming 
  for a brutal purge in the political class &#151; again, no matter how &#151;, 
  while on the streets a well-organized Leftist mob beatifies Fidel Castro on 
  account of crimes four times as big as those that exposed Pinochet to universal 
  scorn.
<p>Does anyone doubt that there is a revolution brewing in this country? I won' 
  t waste my time trying to prove what is obvious. I will go straight to the next 
  item: revolution of who against who?
<p>Carl Schmitt defined 
politics as the direct confrontation that aims at solving, by means of force &#151; 
whether psychic or physical &#151; a conflict that can no longer be judged by the rational 
examination of the contending theses. Politics is, in short, of the same nature 
as war. Human relationships become politicized when the mediating role of moral, 
religion, superior culture, customs and traditions, etc. are abolished. And the 
more they do, the more everything gradually assumes the features of a fight for 
life or death between irreconcilable factions. In the eve of a war or revolution, 
politics invades hearths, brings apart parents and children, breaks up friendships, 
vanquishes respect, sympathy, tolerance. All things become as clear-cut and linear 
as a sword's edge. Only one question becomes at all relevant: on which side you 
are. It's "us" against "them", friends against foes. The world has been split 
in two and you must decide, because your indecision is taken as a proof of your 
hostility. In this way you are put, under protest as it may be, in the party opposite 
to that of the person who posed the question in the first place.<p>Being things 
as they are, it is no surprise that, in order to win over the meek and the weak, 
the apostles of the revolution should present quite a simple picture of themselves 
and their adversaries: black on white, where everything is darkness on one side, 
and all the light is on the other side. The revolutionary discourse defines both 
itself and its adversary at the same time. Once the field has been divided, there's 
nothing left but to choose. It is therefore highly appropriate to examine the 
revolutionary discourse in order to make a conscious decision.<p>The two factions 
of the Brazilian conflict are already perfectly defined, according to the revolutionaries 
of the moment. On one side is the Right: the government, with the globalist powers 
as their allies, bent on imposing on the country a neoliberal capitalist model 
based upon giving away our assets to international birds of prey. On the other 
is the Left, nationalistic and progressive, intent on defending what's ours, willing 
to face the world, if needs be, to invert the terms of an unjust bargain that 
oppresses the people so that bankers may benefit.<p>That said, any citizen whose 
moral sense isn't clouded by selfish interests will undoubtedly choose the latter. 
If we judge the matter on the terms presented by the Left, there is no possible 
doubt. Even myself, who hate globalism as much as I love Brazil, will join the 
vanguard of the revolution to fire, if I can, the first shot on the damned foreign 
agents.
<p>But then a problem comes up. What if the revolutionary equation, so sharp and 
  clear in its verbal formula, does not actually correspond to the division of 
  forces in dispute? What if, underneath the apparent factions, yet more powerful 
  agents, whose many colors do not fit into the two-color spectrum of revolutionary 
  discourse, are taking steps in the backstage to deviate both sides' actions 
  from their overly plain and schematic course? What if, as so often is the case 
  with human action, the confrontation of discourses does not reflect the confrontation 
  of real forces? Then no one can be sure that the winning discourse will lead 
  to power the faction it nominally represents, rather than, by the hand of the 
  devil, the opposite faction or any other, of which nobody has ever heard. This 
  is almost invariably the fate of revolutions. In the French revolution, the 
  people were opposed to royalty. It was a military neo-aristocracy who eventually 
  rose to power, and at the end of its reign returned to power the old aristocracy, 
  which had only left it in order to make way for a bourgeois oligarchy that had 
  already become noble by buying titles. In the Russian revolution, workers and 
  peasants were nominally opposed to the feudal royalty and the army. It was the 
  revolutionary middle-class intelligentsia who rose to power.
<p>The slightest misplacement between discourse 
and reality, in these times, turns revolution into a bloody waste that produces 
no more than an even worse and more oppressive situation than the former.<p>Having 
chosen simply to listen to the discourse, let us take a step back and behold the 
gaping abyss between words and facts.<p>On one side is the government. It is true 
that, in the economic sphere, it favors international capitalism. But does it 
mean we have a Right-wing government? How can it be Right-wing if, more than any 
of its forerunners, it is earnestly dedicated to make the national education system 
into an official system of Marxist indoctrination? How can be Right-wing a government 
that sponsors and encourages all the boldest demands of international neo-Leftism, 
like abortion, feminism, and affirmative action? How can a President be Right-wing, 
who not only openly declares himself a follower of Antonio Gramsci, but also puts 
his teachings into practice more tenaciously and efficiently than the Left itself, 
handing over the government's psychological action machine to the "cultural revolution" 
destined to sweep away from people's soul all traditional values which oppose 
the revolutionary uprising?<p>On the other side is the Left. It is true that it 
is valiantly opposed to the selling of some State companies; remarkably, those 
that are now under control of its party members. But how can be nationalistic 
the organizations sponsored by Mr. David Rockefeller, one of the masterminds of 
capitalist globalism? How can the left-wing men who govern Rio de Janeiro be nationalists, 
whose first concern was to follow to the letter the firearm control program conceived 
directly by the New World Order headquarters? How can a young governor &#151; Garotinho &#151; be a nationalist, who having hardly begun his political career, has already 
been promoted by Time magazine to "great leader of the third millennium"? How 
can the men of the MST be nationalists, who are sponsored and spoiled by the British 
Royal House? How can the Brazilian movement of affirmative action be nationalistic, 
that not only directly imports a North-American legal model, but is also sponsored 
by Ford Foundation, by the European Economic Community and by BankBoston, and 
that denies national unity to affirm racial unity beyond it, in a policy of outspoken 
divisionism from which only international ambitions can benefit? How can the ecological 
and pro-Indian Left be nationalistic, that favors the occupation of our territory 
by international NGOs?<p>I regret to inform that this whole revolution business 
is not at all clear. There is no nationalistic Left struggling against an internationalist 
Right. There are internationalists everywhere &#151; some trying, on the Right, to 
stifle Brazilian nationalism under liberal pretexts, and some, on the Left, trying 
to corrupt it, recycle it and induce it to serve, in full unconsciousness, the 
New World Order. The former call themselves conservatives, but do all within their 
means to stifle all popular economic initiative under a leaden bureaucracy. The 
latter call themselves nationalists, but their programs and pretexts are issued 
straight from the same headquarters that dictate the speeches of the former. Brazil 
is an island of naiveté surrounded by scoundrels in all directions.<p>Our so-called 
revolution will have only one winner, and it won't be us, Brazilians. Worse still, 
this winner will get the upper hand, no matter which one of the clashing armies 
wins the apparent battle. If the revolution is stifled or emptied, the present 
establishment will go on retailing the State. If it is victorious, it will receive 
the bill referent to all international help that made it possible, and there will 
be no compromise, no groveling, no submission enough to quench the thirst for 
recognition of the Left's globalist patrons, from Rockefeller to Prince Charles.<p>To 
those who, after all that, still use the nominal definitions of capitalism and 
socialism as a basis for their reasoning, objecting that the latter is essentially 
opposed to the interests of multinational capital, I ask that they step down for 
a while from their terminological pedestal, that they leave for a while the glass 
dome of their abstractionism, and agree to observe what is going on in China. 
For two decades the soi disant conservative academics, who are in fact as conservative 
as I am an Eskimo, have been promising us that the inflow of foreign capital would 
dissolve by itself the hard shell of Chinese bureaucracy. This would bring about, 
along with an increase on business, the end of communism and the dawn of Chinese 
freedom. With this pretext they have made a lot of money in dealings with China &#151; and the old regime is still there, strong and steady, getting rich on account 
of its partnership with the international monopolist capital, which in turn is 
getting rich over the cheap workforce of a people disciplined by the most effective 
human being taming machine ever seen in this world, the communist dictatorship. 
China was the big political-economical laboratory of the 20th century. It was 
there that the formula of the "double regime" was successfully tested &#151; which 
at the bottom line is not double at all; it is only the repetition of the classical 
alliance between the State and the monopolist capital. A regime we have been acquainted 
with for a long time, the good old fascist economy. That China needs to keep a 
façade of nationalism, as harmless as a transsexual just gone out of surgery, 
is something that should not surprise us: the nationalistic discourse is still 
the easiest pretext of all forms of fascism. But how are we to believe in this 
nationalism if the President of the United States of America himself is suspect 
of participation in the transmission of nuclear secrets to China? No, nobody will 
mess with China nor will China mess with anybody. China is what it has always 
been and, now that it has found a new way to extend the life of its regime at 
the expense of other people's money, it will never come out from where it now 
stands. China will never oppose the New World Order, for the simple reason that 
it has been great for China, and that there is no incompatibility between global 
capitalism and a local socialism that is well integrated in the New Order.
<p>If that kind of socialism can exist in China, why couldn't it exist here in 
  Brazil? And by the way, what is actually easier for the globalist powers &#151; 
  to take risks on a Brazilian market economy tending to conquer new markets and 
  therefore likely to become protectionist tomorrow or later, or a socialist economy 
  where everything is foreseen and delimited beforehand, including the place of 
  honor reserved to foreign capital? It is with these things in sight that the 
  masterminds of globalism invest, fearless, on the future of our Left, advising 
  Garotinhos, financing affirmative action activists, awarding land invaders.
<p>Our revolution, alas, is a sham. By 
joining it, we risk wasting on a fraud the scarce reserves of our nationalism. 
And our nationalism will take on the responsibility of a violent transition only 
to find out, once it is done with, that there is no longer a place for it in the 
resulting new order. Brazil will have become socialist, yes, but this socialism 
will be very well integrated in the globalist scheme of those who have planned 
it, stimulated it and financed it from New York and London.<p>Disgracefully, the 
antagonist hypothesis to the revolution, the President's fake normality, is also 
a fraud. It is a fraud because, pretending to oppose the revolution, it rather 
fosters it by all cultural and educational means available. This is a proof that, 
under the disguise of conservative discourse, what it upholds is not classical 
capitalist liberalism, the true liberalism of free market and of incentive to 
the economic creativity of the people, but globalist monopolism. Which, as we 
have seen, far from having something to object to socialism, makes use of it right 
in front of our noses as a means to swerve, spend and wear down the small amount 
of nationalism we have left.<p>If they have got something above their shoulders, 
if they want to get to the 21st century politically alive, our nationalists will 
resign from any complicity with the Left, preserving their identity even at the 
cost of losing some misleading alliances. And the conservatives, if they do not 
want to serve as an instrument to the most violently commanding monopolism the 
world has ever known, they'd better stay away from all ersatz capitalism and get 
some dialogue done, as fast as they still can, with the sincere nationalists.<p>It 
is true that authentic liberals are as few and far between as authentic nationalists, 
and both of these factions together are the minority within the minority next 
to the two giant social-globalists: the government and the Left.
<p>But he who sacrifices his identity so as not to lose the help of false sponsors 
  sells himself for nothing. And he who resigns from all the misleading appearances 
  of the moment so as to remain faithful to himself gets the realm of reality, 
  from where he can wait until the two illusions destroy one another and it is 
  his turn to win both sides of the field.
