      <p>In <i>My Childhood and Youth</i>, Albert Schweitzer recalls the moment 
        when, for the first time, he felt ashamed of himself. He was about 3 years 
        old and was playing in the garden. Then came a bee and stung his finger. 
        He cried and was helped by his parents and neighbors. Suddenly, little 
        Albert realized that the pain had already been gone for several minutes 
        and that he continued to cry only to retain the attention of the audience. 
        When he told this story, Schweitzer was in his seventies. He had behind 
        him a life of achievements, a great life of an artist, doctor, philosopher, 
        the life of a Christian soul devoted to helping the poor and the sick. 
        But he still felt the shame of that first time he cheated. This feeling 
        persisted through the years in the depth of his memory, kicking his conscience 
        at every new temptation of fooling himself. </p>
      <p> It should be noted that those around him had not noticed anything: it 
        was only the little Schweitzer who knew of his shame, only he had to account 
        for his act before his conscience and his God. I am convinced that experiences 
        like this one – the acts without witnesses, as I use to call them – are 
        the only possible basis upon which a man can develop an authentic, rigorous 
        and autonomous moral conscience. Only one who in solitude knows how to 
        be rigorous and just with himself – and against himself – is capable of 
        judging others with justice, instead of being led by the screaming crowd, 
        the propaganda stereotypes, or by self-interest disguised in beautiful 
        moral pretexts. </p>
      <p> The reason for this is self evident: a man must be free from all external 
        surveillance to be sure that he is looking to himself, and not to a social 
        role, and only then will he be able to make a totally sincere judgment. 
        Only one who is master of himself is free – and nobody is master of himself 
        if he cannot withstand glancing alone into his own heart. </p>
      <p> Even the most candid conversation, the most spontaneous confession do 
        not replace this interior examination, because they are valid only if 
        they are the very expression of an interior examination, and not mere 
        passing outbursts, induced by a casually stimulating atmosphere or by 
        vain candor. </p>
      <p> On top of that, it is not only the moral dimension of conscience that 
        develops itself through this confrontation: it is the whole conscience 
        – cognitive esthetic, practical. For the interior examination is at once 
        a bringing together and a setting apart: it is the solitary judgment which 
        creates the true intimacy of a man with himself, while it also creates 
        the distance, the interior space in which life experiences and knowledge 
        are acquired, deepened and personalized. Without this internal space, 
        without this personal &quot;world&quot; gained in solitude, man is but 
        a pipe through which information flows in and out, as food transformed 
        into leftovers. </p>
      <p> Now, not all human beings are endowed by Providence with a spontaneous 
        perception and a precise judgment of their sins. Without these gifts, 
        the will for justice is corrupted into a projective inculpation of others 
        and into &quot;rationalization&quot; (in the psychoanalytical meaning 
        of the word). Who has not been given these gifts at birth must acquire 
        them through education. Therefore, moral education consists less in memorizing 
        lists of rights and wrongs than in establishing a moral environment conducive 
        to self-examination, to interior seriousness, to the responsibility of 
        each one of knowing what he was doing when nobody was watching. </p>
      <p> During two millennia, such an environment was created and sustained 
        by the Christian practice of the &quot;examination of conscience&quot;, 
        equivalents of which can be found in other religious and mystic traditions, 
        but not in contemporary lay culture. There is Psychoanalysis, there is 
        psychotherapy, but they only work in this context when they preserve the 
        religious reference to personal guilt and to its healing through confession 
        before God. As society de-Christianizes itself (or, mutatis mutandis, 
        as it loses its Islamic or Judaic content), that reference is diluted 
        and clinic techniques usually lead to the opposite outcome: they abolish 
        the sentiment of guilt, exchanging it for a selfish hardening which is 
        mistaken for &quot;maturity&quot;, or for a self-complacent, limp and 
        crooked ability to adapt, which is mistaken for &quot;sanity&quot;. </p>
      <p> The difference between the religious technique and its modern imitations 
        is that it summarizes, in a single dramatic experience, the pain of guilt 
        and the joy of total liberation. And this cannot be achieved by lay techniques, 
        exactly because they entirely miss the dimension of a &quot;Final Judgment&quot;, 
        of the confrontation with an eternal destiny which, by giving to this 
        experience a metaphysical meaning, raised the desire for personal responsibility 
        to the heights of a nobility of soul with which the appearances of &quot;citizenship 
        ethics&quot; cannot even dream about. </p>
      <p> For the past two centuries, modern culture has endeavored whatever it 
        can to debilitate, suffocate and banish from the soul of each man the 
        capacity for this supreme experience in which self-conscience is demanded 
        to its utmost, the only one in which someone may acquire an authentic 
        measure of the possibilities and duties of the human condition. &quot;Lay 
        ethics&quot; , &quot;education for citizenship&quot; is all that is left 
        externally when the internal conscience shuts up and when man’s actions 
        do not mean anything beyond violation or observance of a code of conventional 
        acts and casual interests. </p>
      <p> In this sense, &quot;ethics&quot; is pure adaptation to the exterior, 
        without any intimate echo other than the one which can be obtained by 
        the forceful internalization of slogans, ready-made sentences and words 
        of order. It is the sacrifice of conscience on the shrine of the official 
        lie of the day.</p>
