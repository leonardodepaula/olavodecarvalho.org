      <br>
      <p>Since the fall of the URSS, our national left has made efforts day and 
        night to warn our nationalists — especially those from the Armed Forces 
        — against the danger of the unipolar world, and to persuade them to become 
        leftist for the sake of patriotism. There are people that make a living 
        of this, and there are people — even in the Armed Forces — who believe 
        in them. But only a perfect idiot does not realize that the dominant world 
        power that imposes on us the economic policies against which the left 
        fights is the same one that imposes on us the politically correct concepts, 
        abortion, feminism, ecology and all the cultural models that constitute 
        the program of the left itself. </p>
      <p>It is much less possible for an average sane mind to avoid noticing that 
        the multimillionaire foundations and multinational companies that subsidize 
        the diffusion of these new models of conduct are the same that, on the 
        other hand, support the implementation of the New World Order and of the 
        economic policies that the apostles of these models claim to execrate. 
      </p>
      <p>And whomever notices these two things cannot but reach the conclusion 
        that the unipolar world is even more unipolar than the spokesmen from 
        the left would wish to be known. It is so unipolar that from it come not 
        only the proposals the left hates, but also the ones it loves and personifies. 
        And from it, equally, comes the money used to subsidize the implementation 
        of one thing and the other. </p>
      <p>The left, in sum, utilizes a stereotyped vocabulary from the time of 
        bipolarity to deceive the nationalists, disorient them and subjugate them 
        to the global strategy, attracting their attacks to a false target so 
        that they do not realize where the real one is. The essential component 
        of this vocabulary is the old identification of “North-American” with  
        “conservative-capitalist”, of which we derive, automatically, the confusion 
        of nationalism with statism, the Welfare State and, last not least, Socialism. 
      </p>
      <p>It is with the aim of legitimizing this brutal farce that the current 
        discourse of men from the left against the IMF and the New World Order 
        presents these two phenomena as if they were the quintessence of conservative-capitalism 
        and not precisely the opposite — as history demonstrates — just pure socialist 
        inventions destined to strangle, together with economic freedom, political 
        freedom in the world. The IMF and the New World Order are chapters in 
        the history of an overwhelming centralization that sacrifices all in the 
        altar of bureaucratic control and planned economy, idols a thousand times 
        denounced, whose mystical powers the socialist propaganda promises will 
        heal all maladies. Of the first, its own inventor, Lord Keynes, said it 
        was “essentially a socialist conception”. As to the second, it was from 
        beginning to end the creation of the famous Londoner “think tank” of gradualist 
        socialism that, after passing through several denominations, ended up 
        becoming notorious as the Fabian Society. It was one of its most illustrious 
        members, the writer H. G. Wells, who delineated, in 1928, the entire program 
        of the New World Order and published it in his book  “Open Conspiracy”. 
      </p>
      <p>“Open” is poetic license. So is “conspiracy”. The Fabian socialism never 
        got involved in attacks, gatherings, or manifestations, much less in basement 
        conspiracies. All it did was to prepare intellectuals to be placed in 
        high-level assessorial positions from which they could, discreetly but 
        without any secrecy, inoculate socialist ideas inside the minds of government 
        leaders. This scheme was invented by the theoretician Graham Wallas, who, 
        five decades in advance, formulated the Gramscian strategy of the “occupation 
        of spaces” and of  “passive revolution” (and to think that Gramsci even 
        poses as a genius!). The magnitude of the effects of this things contrasts 
        singularly with the circumspection of the means. Practically all the great 
        turns of modern economy towards the centralizing and socializing trends 
        of the welfare State were planned by Fabian socialists. Just to give you 
        an idea of the reach of their influence, the government plans from three 
        of the most powerful — and the most state-centralizing — among the presidents 
        of the USA, Roosevelt, Kennedy, and Johnson, were directly copied from 
        works of Fabian authors, and even adopted their titles: Roosevelt’s “New 
        Deal” comes from a Stuart Chase book, Kennedy’s “New Frontier” from a 
        book by Henry Wallace, and Johnson’s “Great Society” from a book by Graham 
        Wallas himself. </p>
      <p>Regardless of their <em>soft style, </em><em>rather </em>social-democratic 
        than communist, the Fabian always considered the URSS a valued ally in 
        their fight against conservative-capitalism. Deep down, it was much more 
        than this: deserters from KGB informed that at least one of the books 
        by Sidney Webb, the most famous president of the Fabian Society, was not 
        written by him, but came already written from the Soviet Ministry of Foreign 
        Relations. It is understandable. Much earlier than Gramsci, the URSS had 
        also discovered the virtues of reformist gradualism that, from above and 
        without hardness, socializes the world faster than thousands of Che Guevaras 
        could — these being the authentic scapegoats of the only socialism that 
        always ends victorious. </p>
      <p>The supreme advantage of the discreet method is that, when the ingenious 
        state-centralizing plans from unknown socialist intellectuals from the 
        people at last weigh heavily in the pockets of the masses with the immeasurable 
        cost of their foolishness, there always are in the market radical left 
        intellectuals who, ignoring or pretending to ignore all the work of their 
        Fabian partners, lay all the blame of the disaster on...  conservative 
        capitalism! </p>
      <p>Let not thy left hand see what thy right hand does, teaches the Bible. 
        Socialism has its own demoniacal version of this teaching: let not thy 
        noisy masses see what thy silent allies do  — and thus, not knowing who 
        oppresses them, they will detonate their fury on the scapegoat that is 
        most convenient to the strategy. </p>
      <p>All that is left to know is whether our nationalists — specially the 
        ones from the Armed Forces — will consent to reduce themselves to playing 
        the part of manipulated masses.</p>
