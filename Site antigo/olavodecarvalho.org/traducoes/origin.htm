      <p align=left><b>Read some of the facts that misinformation tries to cover 
        up</b></p>
      <p align=center>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>While center-stage in Brazil features a procession of professional liars 
        and amateur idiots alerting against George W. Bush’s “paranoia,” as if 
        the September attacks were delirious images dreamed up by the right to 
        justify the mistreatment of defenseless leftists, the analyses of people 
        studying the affairs are kept far from society, in turn unable to understand 
        the events that will shape their lives, in possibly tragic ways, in the 
        coming years.</p>
      <p>One of specialists is Colonel Stanislav Lunev, a name completely unknown 
        in this part of the world. A former member of Russia’s Army administration, 
        he is the highest ranking spy to desert the Soviet military, the GRU, 
        in history. Today he is a security consultant for the U.S. government.</p>
      <p>At the beginning of the 1990s, he alerted the CIA that Russia, while 
        dismantling the socialist economic system, still maintained its so-called 
        “special organs” intact – especially the GRU – and that these would continue 
        to develop meticulous plans to wage war against the U.S. He noted that 
        “this war could begin with a diversionary operation, some type of terrorist 
        attack.”</p>
      <p>Today, following the attacks, he says: “I have no doubt that Russia is 
        behind these terrorist groups, financing them and supplying them.” It’s 
        true that Moscow has declared its solidarity with the U.S., but it also 
        did so during the Gulf War, even while sending technicians and equipment 
        to aid Saddam Hussein. If not for a secret Russian alliance with the Afghanis, 
        how could one explain that this nation, after losing 1 million of its 
        people in combat with Soviet troops and surviving only thanks to American 
        support, could forget its animosity against the aggressor and turn blind 
        rage against the benefactor?</p>
      <p>More importantly, Afghani military commander Gulbaddin Hekmatiyar has 
        always been involved in the Soviet incentive scheme and taken advantage 
        of international drug trafficking, as told to American authorities in 
        1968 by General Jan Sejna, who abandoned his post as spokesman for the 
        party’s Central Committee in the Czech Ministry of Defense. Sejna provided 
        direct testimony to the deals between Soviets and Chinese, since the 1950s, 
        for flooding the U.S. with cocaine and using drugs to finance the Communist 
        revolution in Latin America, which is today in control of Colombia.</p>
      <p>In light of this, Colonel Lunev warns that now the escalation of anti-American 
        violence has barely begun and only an energetic and determined response 
        can stop the plans for full-blown war, as stated Ulema-i-Afghanistan, 
        the assembly of Afghani religious leaders, who urge nothing less than 
        the “total elimination of American through force.” This assembly has no 
        authority to declare a <i>jihad</i> for all Muslims, as it is doing, because 
        that declaration can only be approved by an <i>umma</i>, an international 
        community of educated Muslims, according to Koranic law, and the majority 
        of these leaders are staunchly against a war of extermination. But, as 
        I describe below, so-called “Islamic fundamentalists” are stomping on 
        the fundamentals of Islam: their ideology is not that of Islam, it’s rather 
        a type of “theology of liberation,” an abusive and macabre politicization 
        of the Koran’s message. For this reason, they have no scruples in allying 
        with the assassins of their fellow followers against the one country that, 
        in a moment of agony, extended a saving hand to Muslim fighters.</p>
