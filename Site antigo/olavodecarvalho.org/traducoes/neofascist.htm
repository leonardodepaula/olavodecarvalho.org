<p>Ever since the fall of the USSR, the agenda of the world's left has been restricted 
  to the demands of homosexuals, pro-abortion militants, feminists, pedophiles 
  and black racists such as Louis Farrakhan. Such demands may look modest next 
  to the overtly promethean revolutionary goals of the old communist movement, 
  but the truth is that the more concessions these groups obtain from an infinitely 
  compliant society, their cries become more enraged, their ambitions wider, their 
  exigencies more profound and frightful. In the end, the new left wishes to turn 
  humanity upside down, to an extent which if Marx himself were to be faced with 
  the audacity of these proposals, he would turn away horrified as a conservative 
  catholic.</p>
<p>&#9;Homosexuals, as an example, who began moaning for the right of not being 
  arrested for the private practice of sodomy between adults, now groan in defense 
  of nothing else than pedophilia, demanding that it is not only tolerated by 
  the rest, but taught in schools. There is, in the USA, a "Man-Boy Love Association", 
  and nobody dares to accuse its members of being apologists of crime. Everybody 
  knows that whoever does it will be running the risk of getting beaten, arrested, 
  or at least smashed under the feet of the homosexual media lobby, which is probably 
  the most terrible defamatory machine that humanity has known since the end of 
  the activities of the Komintern and of the Propaganda Department of the III 
  Reich.</p>
<p>&#9;Black activists began claiming the opportunity to have equal access to 
  the rights and benefits of Western Civilization which the whites had. Now that 
  they have obtained it, they demand that this Civilization be overtly condemned 
  at schools, and that everybody praises African cultures which despised human 
  life and which took arms to preserve slavery when England began to restrain 
  the trade of black slaves. And today the oppressive control of the <i>black 
  pride</i> is so authoritarian that, in the USA, namely the land of the free 
  press, no great newspaper dared to publish one statistic from the Justice Department 
  - which was freely imparted in other parts of the world - showing that the rate 
  of murders of whites by blacks has been growing immensely, either in proportion 
  or in absolute figures, since the advent of the civil rights laws of the Johnson 
  government; laws which, thanks to the perverse inclination of the human heart, 
  specially when worked up by Machiavellian opportunists, ended up producing among 
  its beneficiaries rather resentment than gratitude.</p>
<p>&#9;Ecologists, who began by screaming alerts in favour of the endangered species, 
  now demand from the government the prohibition to kill even species which are 
  in ceaseless quantitative growth - like the coyotes whose apocalyptic breeding 
  is threatening the flocks of lambs in the North-American state of Utah to extinction. 
  At the same pace, films of ecological ideology, which began as Arcadian idylls 
  of cows and lions, now portray as a supreme moral standard the bloody destruction 
  of mankind by wolves and leopards - the latter having risen to the condition 
  of vindicating angels acting in the service of some justice divinity from the 
  dark, the technopop counterfeit of the Biblical Jehovah. </p>
<p>&#9;As to the feminists, who began demanding simply the right to vote, nothing 
  is more revealing about the nature of their present ambitions than this statement 
  by one of Lorena Bobbit's friends: "Cutting off her husband's penis and calling 
  an ambulance to help him just after that, Lorena has become a symbol of the 
  ideal woman of our time." <i>Non raggionam di lor, ma guarda e passa</i>.</p>
<p>&#9;Any adult who, aware of the grotesque absurdity of these right-claiming 
  discourses, restricts himself to laughing at them as mere harmless extravagancies, 
  is only laughing at his own sons' disgrace, who will be condemned to live in 
  a world where these delirious fancies will be the Law and will have at their 
  side the massive police force of the State to enforce them. A preview of the 
  moral criteria which will guide the life of the future State was already given 
  by President Clinton, who, having granted refuge to all homosexuals who may 
  feel bothered in their native countries, denied the very same right to the Chinese 
  mothers who refuse to abort their babies and to the Chinese doctors who refuse 
  to perform the abortions imposed by the government: our children will live under 
  the guard of a State in which the fantasies of the most frivolous eroticism 
  will be protected by the Law and moral conscience will be repressed as a straying 
  of behaviour.</p>
<p>&#9;At this point, every laugh is no more than the superficial expression of 
  something that is, actually, a deep convulsion of fear. Everywhere, relying 
  on a more and more ferocious and insane rhetoric of hate, and on the more and 
  more devastating and global support of the world's great assets and on millionaire 
  media, along with the complicity of more and more cynical authorities, these 
  movements spread an atmosphere of fear and obsessive self-repression, where 
  the mere thought of being unpleasant to them is enough to fill a person's mind 
  with the most ominous presentiments. </p>
<p>&#9;This atmosphere is unmistakably fascist, and its spread becomes easier 
  as it bases itself more and more on a falsely alarmist discourse directed at 
  the threat of the rebirth of right-wing nationalist regimes which were extinguished 
  fifty years ago - a rebirth that is more strongly denounced as imminent the 
  more one can be sure that the present conditions of global economy make it totally 
  impossible: the dead horse is flogged so that the kick of the living horse be 
  accepted as a demonstration of tenderness.</p>
