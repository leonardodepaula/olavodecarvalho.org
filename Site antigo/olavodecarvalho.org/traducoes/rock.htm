      <p><b>“Lost, I contest myself”<br>
        (Chico Buarque de Hollanda,<i> in</i> Calabar)</b></p>
      <p>What happened in Rock in Rio is the living image of the national schizophrenia. 
        The guy dresses himself up as an American, jumps and dances all day long 
        to the sound of American music and, when he sees on the screen the flag 
        of the United States, gets inflamed with patriotic feelings and cries 
        against cultural colonialism. After that he keeps on jumping – and throws 
        cans in protest on the head of Carlinhos Brown, when he wants to spoil 
        the festival of Americanisms by playing music from Bahia. Have you ever 
        seen something like this? It’s Olívio Dutra drinking Coca-Cola inside 
        a bowl of chimarrão – to hide it – and making a speech against the “black 
        water of imperialism”. </p>
      <p>But, in the Social Forum of Porto Alegre, this image acquired body, life 
        and movement: amidst the boo-hoos and cries against the New World Order, 
        the illustrious assembly manifested its love for the global labor law, 
        to the unarming of the civilians, to preferential racial quotas, and to 
        the control of the Internet – four fifths of the program of the New World 
        Order. The remaining fifth was object of debate only because the participants 
        want to do all this with the economic procedures from Cuba, from Vietnam 
        and North Korea. That most certainly will not be reason for discussion 
        for very long, because the New World Order knows how to respect the independence 
        of the nations and how to leave them alone, in a stinking hole, when they 
        make the preferential option for suicide. With the greatest tranquility, 
        it turned its back to the peoples of Africa, that used to cry in rebellion 
        against the international capitalism that would not leave them alone, 
        and now foam at the mouth with hate towards the international capitalism 
        that abandoned them. In the future socialist Brazil, while we fight like 
        maniacs for a rat leg to eat, Olívio Dutra, showing us with indignation 
        an empty can of Coca-Cola, will say that it is all the fault of the goddamned 
        Ford that abandoned him when he most needed it. </p>
      <p>When I say this country is crazy, insane, needing urgent psychiatric 
        care, people think I am joking. But look at the number of our countrymen 
        that announce socialism to us with the seriousness and the deliberation 
        of someone who had in his hands a saving remedy. The richest and most 
        powerful socialist state that ever existed was the URSS. It was the second 
        industrial power in the world. If Brazil implements socialism today, it 
        will take us half a century, at best, to reach the level of development 
        that the URSS had when, in 1991, it fell apart. How high was this level? 
        According to official data, the average soviet citizen, in 1987, received 
        half the ration of meat that a subject of the czar ate in 1913. The blacks 
        under the apartheid in South Africa had more cars per capita than the 
        soviets. In 1989, with no war or anything like that, there was food rationing 
        in Moscow. The average family (not average, poor), with four members, 
        were pressed together inside a three-square-meter room like the people 
        that live in our favelas. A factory worker, after having worked for a 
        whole year, would earn half of what an American unemployed mother would 
        get in a month from social security. All of this, of course, in the more 
        developed regions. In the periphery – Uzbekistan and Tadzhikistan, for 
        example – 93% of the houses had no sewage and 50% no piped water. The 
        atmosphere was the most polluted in Europe and the investments in health 
        were the lowest in the industrialized world. </p>
      <p>But the socialism to which the Brazilian are asking for recipes of prosperity 
        is not even the one from URSS. It is the one from Cuba, from North Korea, 
        from Vietnam, places where a Russian would only go because of that spirit 
        of patriotic sacrifice with which a British officer from the 19th century, 
        leaving the comfort of his London club, would venture into the forests 
        of Sudan, among mosquitoes and orangutans, for the glory of the Queen. 
        And they say that I’m the one who’s nutty.</p>
